# Configuration

Complete reference for configuring Hindsight services through environment variables.

Hindsight has two services, each with its own configuration prefix:

| Service | Prefix | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **API Service** | `HINDSIGHT_API_*` | Core memory engine |
| **Control Plane** | `HINDSIGHT_CP_*` | Web UI |

---

## API Service

The API service handles all memory operations (retain, recall, reflect).

### Database

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string | `pg0` (embedded) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_READ_DATABASE_URL` | Optional read-replica PostgreSQL URL. When set, recall queries (semantic, BM25, graph, temporal) are routed through a separate connection pool against this URL, offloading the primary. Typically points to a read-only endpoint (e.g., CNPG's `<cluster>-ro` service or Aurora reader endpoint). | Unset (uses primary) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` | Direct PostgreSQL URL for running migrations, bypassing connection poolers (e.g. PgBouncer). When set, advisory locks and Alembic migrations use this URL instead of `DATABASE_URL`. | Falls back to `DATABASE_URL` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DATABASE_SCHEMA` | PostgreSQL schema name for tables | `public` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RUN_MIGRATIONS_ON_STARTUP` | Run database migrations on API startup | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MIGRATION_CONCURRENCY` | Number of tenant schemas to migrate concurrently (PostgreSQL only). Each schema runs in its own process; within a schema migrations are always sequential. Each worker has a fixed startup cost (~1–2s to boot a fresh interpreter), so this only pays off with **many** schemas (roughly tens or more) or slow/high-latency migrations — for a handful of schemas it is slower than sequential. Each worker uses ~3 database connections, so keep `concurrency × 3` within your database's spare `max_connections` (and any PgBouncer pool limit). `1` = fully sequential. Measured at 20k schemas: the per-restart no-op resweep dropped from ~60min to ~11min (≈5×) at `concurrency=12`. | `1` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DATABASE_BACKEND` | Database engine backend: `postgresql` or `oracle` (Oracle 23ai) | `postgresql` |

If not provided, the server uses embedded `pg0` — convenient for development but not recommended for production.

To run against Oracle Database 23ai instead, set `HINDSIGHT_API_DATABASE_BACKEND=oracle` and use an `oracle+oracledb://…` URL. See the [Oracle Database guide](./oracle) for full setup instructions.

The `DATABASE_SCHEMA` setting allows you to use a custom PostgreSQL schema instead of the default `public` schema. This is useful for:
- Multi-database setups where you want Hindsight tables in a dedicated schema
- Hosting platforms (e.g., Supabase) where `public` schema is reserved or shared
- Organizational preferences for schema naming conventions

```bash
# Example: Using a custom schema
export HINDSIGHT_API_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
export HINDSIGHT_API_DATABASE_SCHEMA=hindsight
```

Migrations will automatically create the schema if it doesn't exist and create all tables in the configured schema.

### Database Connection Pool

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DB_POOL_MIN_SIZE` | Minimum connections in the primary pool | `5` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DB_POOL_MAX_SIZE` | Maximum connections in the primary pool | `100` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_READ_DB_POOL_MIN_SIZE` | Minimum connections in the read-replica pool (only used when `READ_DATABASE_URL` is set) | Falls back to `DB_POOL_MIN_SIZE` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_READ_DB_POOL_MAX_SIZE` | Maximum connections in the read-replica pool (only used when `READ_DATABASE_URL` is set) | Falls back to `DB_POOL_MAX_SIZE` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DB_COMMAND_TIMEOUT` | PostgreSQL command timeout in seconds (asyncpg client-side) | `60` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DB_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT` | Connection acquisition timeout in seconds. Bounds how long a caller waits for a free pool connection before failing (retried by the caller); `0` waits indefinitely. | `30` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DB_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT` | Postgres `statement_timeout` applied to every pool connection, in seconds. Server-side safety net for runaway queries. Does **not** apply to Alembic migrations (which run on a separate psycopg2 engine). Set to `0` to disable. | `600` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DB_MAX_PARALLEL_WORKERS_PER_GATHER` | Optional Postgres `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` applied to every pool connection of this process. Unset leaves the server default. Set to `0` on background-worker processes so bulk maintenance queries (consolidation, graph upkeep) run serially instead of fanning out across CPU cores shared with latency-sensitive traffic. | unset |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENTITY_TRGM_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` | Postgres `pg_trgm.similarity_threshold` applied to every pool connection, governing how close a name must be for entity resolution's `%` trigram match to treat it as a candidate. Must be between `0` (exclusive) and `1`. Lower catches more substring-ish matches at higher CPU cost on large entity sets; higher is stricter and cheaper. | `0.15` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENTITY_INTRABATCH_MERGE_SIMILARITY` | Trigram similarity (pg_trgm-equivalent, computed in-memory) at/above which two brand-new names created by the **same** retain are merged into a single entity (in-batch dedup of surface-form variants — e.g. the same name with different emoji/case/suffix). Must be between `0` (exclusive) and `1`. This is a *merge* cutoff, deliberately stricter than the recall-only threshold above; raise it toward `1.0` to merge only near-identical forms. | `0.5` |

For high-concurrency workloads, increase `DB_POOL_MAX_SIZE`. Each concurrent recall/think operation can use 2-4 connections.

To run migrations manually (e.g., before starting the API), use the admin CLI:

```bash
# Migrate the base schema plus all discovered tenant schemas
hindsight-admin run-db-migration

# Or migrate a specific schema only:
hindsight-admin run-db-migration --schema tenant_acme
```

### Vector Extension

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_VECTOR_EXTENSION` | Vector index algorithm: `pgvector`, `vchord`, `pgvectorscale`, or `scann` | `pgvector` |

Hindsight supports four PostgreSQL vector extensions:

#### **pgvector** (HNSW - default)
- In-memory index using Hierarchical Navigable Small World algorithm
- Works well for most embeddings and dataset sizes
- Fast for small-medium datasets (&lt;10M vectors)
- Higher memory usage for large datasets
- Most widely deployed and supported

#### **pgvectorscale** (DiskANN - recommended for scale) ⭐
- Disk-based index using StreamingDiskANN algorithm
- **28x lower p95 latency** and **16x higher throughput** vs dedicated vector DBs
- **60-75% cost reduction** at scale (SSDs cheaper than RAM)
- Superior filtering performance with streaming retrieval model
- Optimized for large datasets (10M+ vectors)
- Supports both **pgvectorscale** (open source) and **pg_diskann** (Azure)
- **Installation:**
  - Open source/self-hosted: `CREATE EXTENSION vector; CREATE EXTENSION vectorscale CASCADE;`
  - Azure PostgreSQL: `CREATE EXTENSION vector; CREATE EXTENSION pg_diskann CASCADE;`

#### **vchord** (vchordrq)
- Alternative high-performance vector index
- Optimized for high-dimensional embeddings (3000+ dimensions)
- Includes integrated BM25 search capabilities
- Requires `vchord` extension

#### **scann** (AlloyDB ScaNN)
- Google's ScaNN index, available on **AlloyDB** and **AlloyDB Omni**
- Uses a single global vector index in `AUTO` mode (per-bank partial indexes are not used)
- **Installation:** `CREATE EXTENSION vector; CREATE EXTENSION alloydb_scann CASCADE;`
- **Index build is deferred** until a table reaches **10,000 populated embedding rows** — AlloyDB cannot build a ScaNN AUTO index on a near-empty table. Until that threshold is crossed, recall falls back to a sequential scan; the global index is built on the next API startup once enough rows exist.
- A ready-to-use Docker Compose stack is provided at [`docker/docker-compose/alloydb/docker-compose.yaml`](https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight/blob/main/docker/docker-compose/alloydb/docker-compose.yaml) for running Hindsight against AlloyDB Omni locally.

**When to use pgvectorscale (DiskANN):**
- Large datasets (10M+ vectors) ⭐
- Complex filtering requirements
- Cost-sensitive deployments
- Production workloads requiring high throughput
- When disk I/O is not a bottleneck

**When to use pgvector (HNSW):**
- Small-medium datasets (&lt;10M vectors)
- Maximum query speed when all data fits in memory
- Simple nearest-neighbor queries without filters
- Standard PostgreSQL deployment preference

**When to use vchord:**
- High-dimensional embeddings (3000+ dimensions)
- Want integrated BM25 search
- Already using vchord for text search

**When to use scann:**
- Running on Google **AlloyDB** or **AlloyDB Omni**
- Want managed ScaNN with `AUTO` mode tuning

**Switching extensions:**

If you need to switch from one extension to another:
1. Set `HINDSIGHT_API_VECTOR_EXTENSION` to your desired extension (`pgvector`, `vchord`, `pgvectorscale`, or `scann`)
2. If your database has existing data, you'll get an error with migration instructions (note: switching **to** `scann` is allowed even with data — the existing index is dropped and rebuilt as ScaNN once the table has at least 10,000 embedding rows)
3. For empty databases, indexes will be automatically recreated on startup

### Text Search Extension

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_TEXT_SEARCH_EXTENSION` | Text search backend: `native`, `vchord`, `pg_textsearch`, `pgroonga`, or `pg_search` | `native` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_TEXT_SEARCH_EXTENSION_NATIVE_LANGUAGE` | PostgreSQL text search dictionary used by the `native` backend (e.g. `english`, `french`, `simple`, `zhparser`) | `english` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_TEXT_SEARCH_EXTENSION_PG_SEARCH_TOKENIZER` | ParadeDB `pg_search` tokenizer used when creating BM25 indexes. Empty uses ParadeDB's default tokenizer (`unicode_words`). | unset |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_BM25_MAX_QUERY_TERMS` | Optional cap on the number of terms in the native PostgreSQL BM25 `tsquery`. Long queries OR-join every normalized token, which can match too much of a large bank. `0` keeps the historical uncapped behavior; a positive value bounds only the `native` backend (other BM25 backends receive the raw query). | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_OUTPUT_LANGUAGE` | When set, forces every LLM-generated artifact (retain facts, consolidation observations, reflect responses) into this language. Free-form (e.g. `Spanish`, `Japanese`). | unset |

Hindsight supports five backends for BM25 keyword retrieval:
- **native** — PostgreSQL's built-in full-text search (`tsvector` + GIN). Language configurable.
- **vchord** — VectorChord BM25 (uses the `llmlingua2` multilingual tokenizer).
- **pg_textsearch** — Timescale's pg_textsearch extension. English-only.
- **pgroonga** — pgroonga full-text search. Multilingual / CJK out of the box.
- **pg_search** — ParadeDB pg_search. True BM25; the only backend that is Citus-compatible.

To switch backends: set `HINDSIGHT_API_TEXT_SEARCH_EXTENSION`. With existing data, you'll get an error and migration instructions; with an empty database the columns/indexes are recreated automatically on startup.

`HINDSIGHT_API_TEXT_SEARCH_EXTENSION_PG_SEARCH_TOKENIZER` only applies when `HINDSIGHT_API_TEXT_SEARCH_EXTENSION=pg_search`, and only when BM25 indexes are created. Changing it for an existing database requires rebuilding the `pg_search` indexes or recreating the database. Supported values are empty/unset, `unicode_words`, `simple`, `whitespace`, `literal`, `literal_normalized`, `chinese_compatible`, `icu`, `jieba`, `source_code`, `chinese_lindera`/`lindera(chinese)`, `japanese_lindera`/`lindera(japanese)`, `korean_lindera`/`lindera(korean)`, `ngram(min,max)`, and `edge_ngram(min,max)`.

For non-English banks (especially CJK) and the language/extraction-language tradeoffs, see the [Multilingual Support](./multilingual) page.

### LLM Provider

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER` | Provider: `openai`, `openai-responses`, `openai-codex`, `claude-code`, `anthropic`, `gemini`, `groq`, `minimax`, `deepseek`, `zai`, `opencode-go`, `nous`, `fireworks`, `ollama`, `ollama-cloud`, `lmstudio`, `llamacpp`, `vertexai`, `bedrock`, `litellm`, `litellmrouter`, `volcano`, `openrouter`, `requesty`, `none` | `openai` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_API_KEY` | API key for LLM provider | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MODEL` | Model name | `gpt-5-mini` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_BASE_URL` | Custom LLM endpoint | Provider default |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT` | Max concurrent LLM requests | `32` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MAX_RETRIES` | Max retry attempts for LLM API calls | `3` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_INITIAL_BACKOFF` | Initial retry backoff in seconds (exponential backoff) | `1.0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MAX_BACKOFF` | Max retry backoff cap in seconds | `60.0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TIMEOUT` | LLM request timeout in seconds | `120` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_REASONING_EFFORT` | Reasoning effort for providers/models that support it (for example `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`) | `low` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TEMPERATURE` | Global override for the sampling temperature of internal LLM calls. Set a number in `[0.0, 2.0]`, or `none` (also `default`/`off`/empty) to **omit** the temperature parameter entirely — required for models that reject explicit temperatures, e.g. Azure `gpt-5.5`, which only accepts its default value. Per-operation variables below override this. | Per-operation defaults |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TEMPERATURE_VERIFICATION` | Temperature for the startup connection check. Number in `[0.0, 2.0]` or `none` to omit. Overrides `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TEMPERATURE`. | `0.0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TEMPERATURE_RETAIN` | Temperature for fact extraction during retain. Number in `[0.0, 2.0]` or `none` to omit. Overrides `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TEMPERATURE`. | `0.1` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TEMPERATURE_REFLECT` | Temperature for the reflect "thinking" step. Number in `[0.0, 2.0]` or `none` to omit. Overrides `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TEMPERATURE`. | `0.9` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TEMPERATURE_CONSOLIDATION` | Temperature for consolidation (mental-model delta and dedup). Number in `[0.0, 2.0]` or `none` to omit. Overrides `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TEMPERATURE`. | `0.0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_SEND_BANK_AS_USER` | Tag outbound LLM and embedding calls with `user=<bank_id>` so gateways (OpenRouter usage accounting, LiteLLM, Helicone) can attribute spend per bank. When enabled, the bank id is transmitted to the upstream provider as the end-user identifier. | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_GROQ_SERVICE_TIER` | Groq service tier: `on_demand`, `flex`, `auto` | `auto` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_OPENAI_SERVICE_TIER` | OpenAI service tier: `flex` for 50% cost savings (OpenAI Flex Processing) | None (default) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_BEDROCK_SERVICE_TIER` | Bedrock service tier: `flex` for 50% cost savings (best-effort inference), `priority` (guaranteed throughput), or `reserved` (provisioned capacity) | Unset (default tier) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_GEMINI_SERVICE_TIER` | Gemini service tier: `flex` for 50% cost savings (best-effort inference) | Unset (default tier) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_EXTRA_BODY` | JSON dict of extra request-body params (e.g. `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_tokens`) merged into every LLM call. Applied across the OpenAI-compatible, Fireworks, Anthropic, Gemini/VertexAI and LiteLLM (incl. Bedrock/Router) providers. Each provider merges them in its own native parameter space, so use that provider's field names (e.g. `max_tokens` for OpenAI/Anthropic vs `max_output_tokens` for Gemini). Also useful for custom model servers (e.g. vLLM `chat_template_kwargs`). | `null` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_DEFAULT_HEADERS` | JSON dict passed as `default_headers` to provider SDK clients. Used by operators routing through proxies / request-tracing middleware (e.g. Cloudflare AI Gateway, Helicone, corporate proxies). Currently wired into the Anthropic provider; other providers can opt in. | `null` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_STRICT_SCHEMA` | Grammar-enforce structured output via `json_schema` `strict: true` instead of the soft "schema-in-prompt + `json_object`" path. Typed Pydantic response models are serialized directly into the OpenAI strict subset: every object rejects additional properties, every declared property is required, and nullable fields remain nullable. Use it with weaker self-hosted models that return prose preambles, markdown ` ```json ` fences, or invalid JSON — which otherwise fail to parse and wedge retain/consolidation. Applies to OpenAI-compatible backends (OpenAI, llama.cpp, vLLM), Codex, and LiteLLM; Gemini already enforces its native `response_schema` regardless, and providers without a strict mode ignore it. | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_STRICT_SCHEMA_RETAIN` | Override `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_STRICT_SCHEMA` for retain (fact extraction) only. Applies to both the streaming and batch extraction paths. | Inherits global |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_STRICT_SCHEMA_REFLECT` | Override `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_STRICT_SCHEMA` for reflect's structured-output extraction only. | Inherits global |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_STRICT_SCHEMA_CONSOLIDATION` | Override `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_STRICT_SCHEMA` for consolidation only (both the batch consolidation call and observation dedup). | Inherits global |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_SUPPORTS_MAX_ITEMS` | Whether the LLM backend accepts JSON Schema `maxItems` in structured-output schemas. Set to `false` for backends such as Bedrock Converse that reject this keyword; consolidation still enforces observation caps after parsing. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_OLLAMA_NUM_CTX` | Optional native Ollama `num_ctx` override for structured-output calls. Leave unset to use the model/server default; set a positive integer only when you need a larger context window. | Unset |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_GEMINI_SAFETY_SETTINGS` | JSON-encoded list of `{category, threshold}` dicts for Gemini/VertexAI content safety filtering | `null` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROMPT_CACHE_ENABLED` | Reuse the fixed system prefix via the provider's explicit prompt cache, billed at the cached-input rate (Gemini/Vertex `CachedContent`). The cached prefix is shared across all banks and soft-fails to an uncached call. Set to `false` to disable. See [Models](./models#provider-capabilities). | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_PROMPT_CACHE_ENABLED` | For reflect specifically, roll a step-by-step context cache forward through the agent's tool loop so each turn reuses the whole prior conversation (system + tools + all prior tool results) at the cached-input rate instead of only the static prefix. Requires `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROMPT_CACHE_ENABLED`. The per-reflect caches are ephemeral and deleted when the reflect ends. Set to `false` to run reflect uncached while leaving prompt caching on elsewhere. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_DEBUG_DUMP_4XX` | Diagnostic: when enabled, on any LLM `4xx` the provider logs `[LLM_4XX_DUMP]` with the request as actually assembled — the serialized request config (response schema + generation params, message bodies stripped) and length-capped per-message previews — so an otherwise-unreproducible rejected request can be inspected. Wired into all remote providers (Gemini/Vertex, OpenAI-compatible incl. Fireworks/Nous, Anthropic, LiteLLM incl. Router, Codex). Off by default; leave off in normal operation. | `false` |

When `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=ollama`, Hindsight no longer sends the previous native API default `num_ctx=16384` unless you set it explicitly. To keep the old request behavior, set `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_OLLAMA_NUM_CTX=16384`; otherwise Ollama uses the model Modelfile or server default.

### LLM Router (LiteLLM Router)

`HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=litellmrouter` runs the default LLM through [LiteLLM's `Router`](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/routing). The config JSON is forwarded verbatim — for fallback chains, load-balancing, rate limits, routing strategies, and the rest of the supported keys, see the [LiteLLM Router docs](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/routing). Hindsight always issues completions against `model_name: "default"`, so include at least one entry with that name.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_LITELLMROUTER_CONFIG` | JSON object passed to `litellm.Router(**config)`. Required when provider is `litellmrouter`. |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_{RETAIN,REFLECT,CONSOLIDATION}_LLM_LITELLMROUTER_CONFIG` | Per-operation overrides. Fall back to the default config when unset. |

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=litellmrouter
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_LITELLMROUTER_CONFIG='{
  "model_list": [
    {"model_name": "default",  "litellm_params": {"model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini", "api_key": "sk-..."}},
    {"model_name": "fallback", "litellm_params": {"model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5", "api_key": "sk-ant-..."}}
  ],
  "fallbacks": [{"default": ["fallback"]}]
}'
```

The config is a credential field — never returned by the bank-config API. Hindsight already retries calls; set `"num_retries": 0` in the Router config to avoid double-retries. Batch APIs aren't supported in router mode.

### Multi-LLM Strategies (failover / round-robin)

Configure additional LLMs **by index** alongside the primary, then choose a strategy for routing across them. This is a provider-agnostic alternative to the LiteLLM Router: the indexed LLMs can be any mix of providers, each fully configured.

The unindexed `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_*` config is the **primary** (member 1). Extra members are numbered from 1:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_<n>_PROVIDER` | Provider for extra member `n` (`n` = 1, 2, ...). Presence of this var defines the member; indices must be contiguous from 1. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_<n>_API_KEY` | API key for member `n` (required unless the provider needs none). | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_<n>_MODEL` | Model for member `n`. | Provider default |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_<n>_BASE_URL` | Base URL for member `n`. | Provider default |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_<n>_REASONING_EFFORT` | Reasoning effort for member `n`. | `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_REASONING_EFFORT` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_<n>_EXTRA_BODY` / `_DEFAULT_HEADERS` | Per-member JSON overrides. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_<n>_BEDROCK_SERVICE_TIER` / `_GEMINI_SERVICE_TIER` | Per-member service tier. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_<n>_VERTEXAI_PROJECT_ID` / `_VERTEXAI_REGION` / `_VERTEXAI_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` | Per-member Vertex AI project, region, and service-account key path (for a `vertexai` member). Each falls back to the global `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_VERTEXAI_*` when unset. | Global / `us-central1` / ADC |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_<n>_LITELLMROUTER_CONFIG` | Per-member LiteLLM Router config JSON (for a `litellmrouter` member). Falls back to the global `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_LITELLMROUTER_CONFIG` when unset. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_STRATEGY` | JSON routing strategy across the chain. Unset = single primary LLM (no change). | - |

The strategy JSON supports two modes:

- `{"mode": "failover"}` — try members in order (primary first); on a member's failure (after its own retries) advance to the next.
- `{"mode": "round-robin"}` — rotate the starting member per request to spread load, then fall through the rest on failure. Add `"weights": [3, 1, ...]` (positive ints, one per member, primary first) for an **unbalanced** rotation.

```bash
# Primary OpenAI, failover to Groq then Anthropic
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=openai
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_API_KEY=sk-...
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_1_PROVIDER=groq
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_1_API_KEY=gsk-...
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_2_PROVIDER=anthropic
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_2_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_STRATEGY='{"mode": "failover"}'

# Weighted round-robin: serve the primary 3x as often as member 1
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_STRATEGY='{"mode": "round-robin", "weights": [3, 1]}'
```

**Per-operation chains.** Each operation can define its own members + strategy with the `RETAIN` / `REFLECT` / `CONSOLIDATION` prefix (e.g. `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_1_PROVIDER`, `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_STRATEGY`). A per-operation slot with no indexed members (or no strategy) inherits the global chain.

The indexed members are credential fields — never returned by the bank-config API and server-level only (not per-bank configurable). **Batch retain** runs on the primary member only; failover/round-robin apply to the interactive retain/reflect/consolidation calls.

### Built-in llama.cpp

The `llamacpp` provider runs a llama.cpp server as a managed subprocess — no external LLM server needed. On first run it auto-downloads a default GGUF model (~3.5 GB). Requires the `local-llm` extra: `pip install 'hindsight-api-slim[local-llm]'`.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLAMACPP_MODEL_PATH` | Path to a GGUF model file. If not set, auto-downloads `gemma-4-E2B-it-Q4_K_M` from HuggingFace. | Auto-download |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLAMACPP_GPU_LAYERS` | Number of layers to offload to GPU. `-1` = all layers (recommended). `0` = CPU only. | `-1` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLAMACPP_CONTEXT_SIZE` | Context window size in tokens. | `8192` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLAMACPP_CHAT_FORMAT` | Chat template format. `null` = auto-detect from GGUF metadata (recommended). | Auto-detect |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLAMACPP_NO_GRAMMAR` | Disable JSON grammar enforcement. Faster inference but less reliable JSON output. | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLAMACPP_EXTRA_ARGS` | Space-separated extra CLI args passed to the llama.cpp server (e.g. `--n_threads 8 --type_k 1`). | - |

```bash
# Minimal setup (auto-downloads model, uses GPU)
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=llamacpp

# Custom model with tuning
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=llamacpp
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT=2
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLAMACPP_MODEL_PATH=~/.hindsight/models/my-model.gguf
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLAMACPP_CONTEXT_SIZE=16384
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLAMACPP_NO_GRAMMAR=true  # faster, less reliable JSON
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLAMACPP_EXTRA_ARGS="--n_threads 8"
```

:::note
The llama.cpp server is shared across all LLM operations (retain, reflect, consolidation). Set `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT=2` to allow retain and consolidation to run concurrently without blocking each other.
:::

### Per-Operation LLM Configuration

Different memory operations have different requirements. **Retain** (fact extraction) benefits from models with strong structured output capabilities, while **Reflect** (reasoning/response generation) can use lighter, faster models. Configure separate LLM models for each operation to optimize for cost and performance.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_PROVIDER` | LLM provider for retain operations | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_API_KEY` | API key for retain LLM | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_API_KEY` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_MODEL` | Model for retain operations | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MODEL` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_BASE_URL` | Base URL for retain LLM | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_BASE_URL` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT` | Extra cap on concurrent retain LLM requests, composed with the global cap. Unset → only the global cap applies. | Unset |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_MAX_RETRIES` | Max retries for retain | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MAX_RETRIES` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_INITIAL_BACKOFF` | Initial backoff for retain retries (seconds) | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_INITIAL_BACKOFF` |

| `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_LLM_BASE_URL` | Base URL for reflect LLM | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_BASE_URL` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT` | Extra cap on concurrent reflect LLM requests, composed with the global cap. Unset → only the global cap applies. | Unset |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_LLM_MAX_RETRIES` | Max retries for reflect | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MAX_RETRIES` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_LLM_INITIAL_BACKOFF` | Initial backoff for reflect retries (seconds) | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_INITIAL_BACKOFF` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_LLM_MAX_BACKOFF` | Max backoff cap for reflect retries (seconds) | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MAX_BACKOFF` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_LLM_TIMEOUT` | Timeout for reflect requests (seconds) | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TIMEOUT` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_LLM_REASONING_EFFORT` | Reasoning effort for reflect operations | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_REASONING_EFFORT` |

| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_LLM_BASE_URL` | Base URL for consolidation LLM | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_BASE_URL` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT` | Extra cap on concurrent consolidation LLM requests, composed with the global cap. Unset → only the global cap applies. | Unset |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_LLM_MAX_RETRIES` | Max retries for consolidation | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MAX_RETRIES` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_LLM_INITIAL_BACKOFF` | Initial backoff for consolidation retries (seconds) | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_INITIAL_BACKOFF` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_LLM_MAX_BACKOFF` | Max backoff cap for consolidation retries (seconds) | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MAX_BACKOFF` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_LLM_TIMEOUT` | Timeout for consolidation requests (seconds) | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TIMEOUT` |

| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_LLM_EXTRA_BODY` | Extra request-body params (JSON dict) for consolidation operations | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_EXTRA_BODY` |

:::tip When to Use Per-Operation Config
- **Retain**: Use models with strong structured output (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude) for accurate fact extraction
- **Reflect**: Use faster/cheaper models (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Groq) for reasoning and response generation
- **Recall**: Does not use LLM (pure retrieval), so no configuration needed
:::

**Example: Separate Models for Retain and Reflect**

```bash
# Default LLM (used as fallback)
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=openai
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxx
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o

# Use GPT-4o for retain (strong structured output)
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o

# Use faster/cheaper model for reflect
export HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_LLM_PROVIDER=groq
export HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_LLM_API_KEY=gsk_xxxxxxxxxxxx
export HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_LLM_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile
```

**Example: Tuning Retry Behavior for Rate-Limited APIs**

```bash
# For Anthropic with tight rate limits (10k output tokens/minute)
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxxxxxxxxx
export HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514

# Reduce concurrent requests for retain to avoid rate limits
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT=3

# Fail faster with fewer retries
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_MAX_RETRIES=3

# Or increase backoff times to wait out rate limit windows
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_INITIAL_BACKOFF=2.0  # Start at 2s instead of 1s
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_MAX_BACKOFF=120.0    # Cap at 2min instead of 1min
```

:::note Per-operation concurrency composes with the global cap
`HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT`, `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT`, and
`HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT` add an extra cap that applies *on top of*
`HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT`. A retain call counts against both the retain cap and the
global cap; a reflect call without a per-op cap is bounded only by the global cap.

To reserve headroom for live chat/reflect on a rate-limited provider, cap retain and
consolidation below the global value — e.g. global=4, retain=1, consolidation=1 leaves
two slots that retain/consolidation cannot consume.

Unlike the per-operation timeout and retry/backoff knobs, the `*_LLM_MAX_CONCURRENT`
caps are process-global semaphores read from the environment once at startup. They are
server-level only (not overridable per tenant/bank) and a change requires a restart.

### Embeddings

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER` | Provider: `local`, `onnx`, `tei`, `openai`, `openai-codex`, `openrouter`, `requesty`, `cohere`, `google`, `zeroentropy`, `litellm`, or `litellm-sdk` | `local` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_MAX_INPUT_TOKENS` | Applies to **every** provider. If set, truncate each text to this many tokens (tiktoken `cl100k_base`, approximate) before embedding. Set it to the model's real input limit (e.g. `8192` for Bedrock Titan V2, or a llama.cpp server's context, with a little headroom) so oversized content is truncated instead of failing the embed call permanently. Off by default. (Deprecated alias: `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_LITELLM_SDK_MAX_INPUT_TOKENS`.) | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_LOCAL_MODEL` | Model for local provider. Models that ship their own search-text and stored-text instructions (e.g. the Qwen3-Embedding family) have them applied automatically — see the note below. | `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_LOCAL_TRUST_REMOTE_CODE` | Allow loading models with custom code (security risk, disabled by default) | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_LOCAL_FORCE_CPU` | Force CPU mode for local embeddings (avoids MPS/XPC issues on macOS) | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_LOCAL_ALLOW_MPS` | Opt in to the Apple Silicon MPS GPU for local embeddings. Disabled by default because MPS caches a distinct kernel/allocator pool per input shape and never releases it, so under variable-length workloads memory grows without bound (idle instances reached ~20 GB). CUDA/XPU are unaffected and still auto-select. | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_MODEL_ID` | Hugging Face model repo for the ONNX provider. Used for auto-download and as the tokenizer fallback. | `intfloat/multilingual-e5-small` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_MODEL_PATH` | Local path to the ONNX graph. When unset, Hindsight downloads `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_FILE` from `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_MODEL_ID`. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_TOKENIZER_NAME_OR_PATH` | Hugging Face tokenizer repo or local tokenizer directory. Set this when using `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_MODEL_PATH`. | Falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_MODEL_ID` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_FILE` | ONNX file path inside the Hugging Face repo. Hindsight also downloads the conventional external-data sidecar with `_data` suffix when present. | `onnx/model.onnx` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_DIMENSIONS` | Expected embedding dimensions. Startup fails if the loaded model returns a different size. | Auto-detected |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_MAX_TOKENS` | Max tokenizer length for ONNX embeddings. | `512` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_POOLING` | Pooling strategy for token embeddings: `mean` or `cls`. Ignored when the ONNX graph returns a pre-pooled 2-D embedding output. | `mean` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_NORMALIZE` | L2-normalize ONNX vectors before storage. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_QUERY_PREFIX` | Prefix applied to query/search text before ONNX embedding. Keep `query: ` for E5 models; set to empty for non-E5 models such as MiniLM or BGE. | `query: ` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_PASSAGE_PREFIX` | Prefix applied to stored memory/document text before ONNX embedding. Keep `passage: ` for E5 models; set to empty for non-E5 models such as MiniLM or BGE. | `passage: ` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_OUTPUT_NAME` | Optional ONNX output name to request when an exported graph exposes a pooled embedding output. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_TEI_URL` | TEI server URL | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key (falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_API_KEY`) | - |

| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_OPENAI_BATCH_SIZE` | Max inputs per `embeddings.create` call for `openai`/`openrouter` providers — lower this when the upstream endpoint enforces stricter limits (e.g. DashScope caps at 10) | `100` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_OPENAI_DIMENSIONS` | Optional requested output dimensions for OpenAI `text-embedding-3` models (e.g., `384` to match an existing pgvector schema) | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | OpenRouter API key for embeddings (falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, then `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_API_KEY`) | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_REQUESTY_API_KEY` | Requesty API key for embeddings (falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_REQUESTY_API_KEY`, then `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_API_KEY`) | - |

| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ZEROENTROPY_DIMENSIONS` | Output dimensions for `zembed-1`. Supported values: `2560`, `1280`, `640`, `320`, `160`, `80`, `40` | `1280` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ZEROENTROPY_ENCODING_FORMAT` | Response encoding: `float` or `base64`. Hindsight decodes either format to float vectors before storage. | `float` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ZEROENTROPY_BATCH_SIZE` | Max inputs per ZeroEntropy embed request | `100` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ZEROENTROPY_LATENCY` | Optional latency mode: `fast` or `slow`. Leave unset to use ZeroEntropy's default routing. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_COHERE_API_KEY` | Cohere API key for embeddings (falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_COHERE_API_KEY`) | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_COHERE_MODEL` | Cohere embedding model | `embed-english-v3.0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_COHERE_BASE_URL` | Custom base URL for Cohere-compatible API (e.g., Azure-hosted) | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_COHERE_OUTPUT_DIMENSIONS` | Output embedding dimensions for Cohere (e.g., `256`, `512`, `1024`). When set, overrides the model's default dimension. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_LITELLM_API_BASE` | LiteLLM proxy base URL for embeddings (falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_LITELLM_API_BASE`) | `http://localhost:4000` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_LITELLM_API_KEY` | LiteLLM proxy API key for embeddings (optional, depends on proxy config; falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_LITELLM_API_KEY`) | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_LITELLM_MODEL` | LiteLLM embedding model (use provider prefix, e.g., `cohere/embed-english-v3.0`) | `text-embedding-3-small` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_LITELLM_SDK_API_KEY` | LiteLLM SDK API key for direct embedding provider access (optional — omit for providers that use ambient credentials, e.g. AWS Bedrock with IAM) | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_LITELLM_SDK_MODEL` | LiteLLM SDK embedding model (use provider prefix, e.g., `cohere/embed-english-v3.0`) | `cohere/embed-english-v3.0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_LITELLM_SDK_API_BASE` | Custom base URL for LiteLLM SDK embeddings (optional) | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_LITELLM_SDK_OUTPUT_DIMENSIONS` | Optional output embedding dimensions (provider-dependent, e.g., `768` for Gemini embedding models) | - |

| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_GEMINI_MODEL` | Gemini embedding model. The `gemini-embedding-2` family (e.g. `gemini-embedding-2-preview`) is supported on both the Gemini API and Vertex AI — because these multimodal models aggregate a multi-input request into one embedding, Hindsight automatically embeds one input per call to keep per-fact vectors. | `gemini-embedding-001` |

Embedding provider selection, credentials, base URLs, model choices, dimensions, encoding format, batch sizes, and latency modes are static server-level settings. They are not hierarchical per-bank overrides. The ONNX settings above are also static, matching the existing `embeddings_local_*` settings.

:::note Models that treat searches and stored text differently

Some embedding models are trained to see a short instruction in front of a search, and nothing (or a different instruction) in front of the text being stored. With the `local` provider, Hindsight applies whichever instructions the model itself ships with — you don't configure anything. The default `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` ships none, so nothing changes for existing deployments; `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-*` ships one for searches only, which is what makes those models retrieve accurately.

The rare case to watch for is a model that also instructs the **stored** side. Switching to one of those changes how new memories are indexed, so anything already stored was indexed differently and will compare poorly against it. Re-index the bank (export and re-import it) after adopting such a model. Search-side-only instructions, which covers every model listed above, need no re-indexing.

:::

#### Local ONNX embeddings

The ONNX provider runs embedding models in-process with ONNX Runtime. Install the optional deps when building your own API environment:

```bash
pip install 'hindsight-api-slim[local-onnx]'
# or, in this repository:
uv sync --project hindsight-api-slim --extra local-onnx
```

You can either let Hindsight download the model from Hugging Face at startup by setting `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_MODEL_ID`, or pre-download the ONNX graph and tokenizer files under the Hindsight repository root.

```bash
cd /path/to/hindsight
mkdir -p models

MODEL_ID=intfloat/multilingual-e5-small
MODEL_DIR=models/intfloat__multilingual-e5-small

uv run --project hindsight-api-slim --extra local-onnx python - <<'PY'
import os
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

snapshot_download(
    repo_id=os.environ["MODEL_ID"],
    local_dir=os.environ["MODEL_DIR"],
    allow_patterns=[
        "onnx/model.onnx",
        "onnx/model.onnx_data",
        "*.json",
        "*.txt",
        "*.model",
    ],
)
PY
```

Then start Hindsight with paths relative to the repository root:

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER=onnx
export HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_MODEL_PATH=./models/intfloat__multilingual-e5-small/onnx/model.onnx
export HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_TOKENIZER_NAME_OR_PATH=./models/intfloat__multilingual-e5-small
export HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_DIMENSIONS=384
export HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_QUERY_PREFIX="query: "
export HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_PASSAGE_PREFIX="passage: "
```

For Docker deployments, mount the same model directory and use container paths:

```yaml
services:
  hindsight:
    volumes:
      - ./models:/app/models:ro
    environment:
      HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER: onnx
      HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_MODEL_PATH: /app/models/intfloat__multilingual-e5-small/onnx/model.onnx
      HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_TOKENIZER_NAME_OR_PATH: /app/models/intfloat__multilingual-e5-small
      HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_DIMENSIONS: "384"
      HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_QUERY_PREFIX: "query: "
      HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_PASSAGE_PREFIX: "passage: "
```

Model-specific examples:

```bash
# sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2: 384 dimensions, no E5 prefixes
export HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_ONNX_MODEL_ID=sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2

```

:::warning
Do not mix embeddings from different models in the same vector index. Switching from `local` to `onnx`, or changing ONNX models, requires re-embedding existing memories/documents even when the vector dimensions happen to match. For example, `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` and `intfloat/multilingual-e5-small` both produce 384-dimensional vectors, but their embedding spaces are not semantically comparable.
:::

:::warning
The default ONNX query/document prefixes (`query: ` and `passage: `) are for E5 models. Clear both prefix variables for non-E5 models such as MiniLM or BGE, otherwise Hindsight will prepend E5-style text to models that were not trained with that format.
:::

#### Common Pitfall: Provider-Specific Embedding Env Var Names

Embedding environment variables include a provider segment in the key name:

`HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_{PROVIDER}_{PARAMETER}`

For example, when `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER=openai`:

| Wrong | Correct |
|---|---|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_BASE_URL` | `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_OPENAI_BASE_URL` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL` | `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_OPENAI_MODEL` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY` | `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_OPENAI_API_KEY` |

This differs from LLM variables, which follow `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_{PARAMETER}` without a provider segment.

:::warning
If embedding keys are misnamed, Hindsight may fall back to default OpenAI embedding settings (for example, `text-embedding-3-small`) and fail with auth errors against the wrong endpoint.
:::

#### DeepSeek and Embeddings

DeepSeek is supported as an **LLM** provider, but it does **not** expose an embeddings endpoint. If your LLM is DeepSeek, use a different embedding provider (for example `local`, `openai`, `cohere`, or `google`).

```bash

#### Embedding Dimensions

Hindsight automatically detects the embedding dimension from the model at startup and adjusts the database schema accordingly. The default model (`BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`) produces 384-dimensional vectors, while OpenAI models produce 1536 or 3072 dimensions.

For `litellm-sdk`, if you set `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_LITELLM_SDK_OUTPUT_DIMENSIONS`, startup uses that output size when the underlying provider supports LiteLLM's `dimensions` parameter (otherwise behavior is unchanged). The same dimension-change rules below apply.

For `zeroentropy`, zembed-1 supports `2560`, `1280`, `640`, `320`, `160`, `80`, and `40` dimensions. ZeroEntropy's API default is `2560`; Hindsight defaults to `1280` so the provider works with the default pgvector HNSW index. Use `2560` with a vector extension that supports higher-dimensional indexes, such as DiskANN/pgvectorscale or ScaNN.

:::warning Dimension Changes
Once memories are stored, you cannot change the embedding dimension without losing data. If you need to switch to a model with different dimensions:

1. **Empty database**: The schema is adjusted automatically on startup
2. **Existing data**: Either delete all memories first, or use a model with matching dimensions

Supported OpenAI embedding dimensions:
- `text-embedding-3-small`: 1536 dimensions
- `text-embedding-3-large`: 3072 dimensions
- `text-embedding-ada-002`: 1536 dimensions (legacy)

Google's `gemini-embedding-001` produces 3072 dimensions natively but supports configurable output dimensionality. Set `HINDSIGHT_API_EMBEDDINGS_GEMINI_OUTPUT_DIMENSIONALITY` to control the output size (default: 768).

ZeroEntropy's `zembed-1` supports Matryoshka dimensions: `2560`, `1280`, `640`, `320`, `160`, `80`, and `40`. Hindsight defaults to `1280` for this provider.

#### Reranker failover chain

Reranking is a refinement stage, but by default a reranker that is unreachable takes
recall down with it. Configure extra rerankers **by index** and Hindsight tries them
in order: if a member fails (timeout, connection error, HTTP error, or an unusable
response), the next one serves the request.

The unindexed `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_*` config is the **primary** (member 0). Extra
members are numbered from 1, and every setting of member `n` carries the same index —
`HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_<n>_<SETTING>` for any `<SETTING>` in the table above:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_<n>_PROVIDER` | Provider for fallback member `n` (`n` = 1, 2, ...). Presence of this var defines the member; indices must be contiguous from 1. Unset = no fallback (default). | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_<n>_<SETTING>` | Any other reranker setting, for member `n` — e.g. `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_1_TEI_URL`, `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_1_COHERE_API_KEY`, `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_1_TEI_HTTP_TIMEOUT`. | Same built-in default as the primary |

An indexed member is read **in isolation**: it inherits nothing from the primary and
nothing from the shared provider keys (`HINDSIGHT_API_COHERE_API_KEY` and friends), so
spell out every setting it needs with its own index. Unset settings fall back to the
same built-in defaults the primary uses. Chain-level settings
(`HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_MAX_CANDIDATES`, `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_SEND_BANK_AS_HEADER`)
stay global and are not indexed.

```bash
# Primary: a self-hosted reranker that is not always up.
export HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_PROVIDER=tei
export HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_TEI_URL=http://workstation:8081

# Member 1: a hosted reranker to fall back on.

# Member 2: last resort — no reranking, keep the fusion order rather than fail.
export HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_2_PROVIDER=rrf
```

Ending the chain with `rrf` makes recall **fail open**: results come back in the order
the retrieval stages produced, exactly as if no reranker were configured, instead of
the request failing. Without an `rrf` member (or with every member down) the error still
surfaces, which is the default behaviour.

Notes:

- Members are tried in order on every request; there is no circuit breaker, so a member
  that is down costs its own timeout on each request before the next one is tried. Keep
  the timeouts of an unreliable primary short (`HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_TEI_HTTP_TIMEOUT`
  and the per-provider `*_TIMEOUT` settings).
- A member that fails to initialize at startup is logged, not fatal — it is retried on
  the next request that reaches it.
- Scores are not comparable across providers (some return calibrated `[0, 1]` relevance,
  others logits), so a request served by a fallback member can score differently from one
  served by the primary. Failovers are logged at `WARNING`.
- The indexed members are credential fields — never returned by the bank-config API, and
  server-level only (not per-bank configurable).

:::tip Sizing a TEI reranker

TEI reserves one slot per text in a rerank request and rejects the request outright
once its pool is full, so start it with at least
`HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_TEI_MAX_CONCURRENT × HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_TEI_BATCH_SIZE`
slots — 1024 for the defaults above, versus TEI's own default of 512:

```bash
text-embeddings-router --max-concurrent-requests 2048 ...
```

Below that threshold, heavy recall traffic makes the reranker reject work it has the
capacity to do. Rejections are retried with backoff, so an undersized pool shows up as
slower recall rather than errors.

#### LiteLLM Proxy vs SDK

- **`litellm`**: Requires running a separate LiteLLM proxy server. Good for centralized configuration, rate limiting, and caching.
- **`litellm-sdk`**: Direct API access without proxy. Simpler setup, lower latency, fewer infrastructure components.

Both support the same providers:
- **Cohere** (`cohere/rerank-english-v3.0`, `cohere/rerank-multilingual-v3.0`)
- **DeepInfra** (`deepinfra/Qwen3-reranker-8B`, `deepinfra/bge-reranker-v2-m3`)
- **Together AI** (`together_ai/Salesforce/Llama-Rank-V1`)
- **HuggingFace** (`huggingface/BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3`)
- **Voyage AI** (`voyage/rerank-2`)
- **Jina AI** (`jina_ai/jina-reranker-v2`)
- **AWS Bedrock** (`bedrock/...`)

#### Jina MLX (Apple Silicon)

The `jina-mlx` provider uses [`jinaai/jina-reranker-v3-mlx`](https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-reranker-v3-mlx), optimized for Apple Silicon. The model (~1.2 GB) is downloaded from HuggingFace Hub automatically on first startup and cached locally.

### Authentication

By default, Hindsight runs without authentication. For production deployments, enable API key authentication using the built-in tenant extension:

```bash
# Enable the built-in API key authentication
export HINDSIGHT_API_TENANT_EXTENSION=hindsight_api.extensions.builtin.tenant:ApiKeyTenantExtension
export HINDSIGHT_API_TENANT_API_KEY=your-secret-api-key
```

When enabled, all requests must include the API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-api-key" \
  http://localhost:8888/v1/default/banks
```

Requests without a valid API key receive a `401 Unauthorized` response.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_TENANT_EXTENSION` | Dotted path to the loaded tenant extension. Set to `hindsight_api.extensions.builtin.tenant:ApiKeyTenantExtension` to require an API key on every request. | *(none; auth disabled)* |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_TENANT_API_KEY` | Shared API key checked by the built-in API-key extension. Sent by clients as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. | *(none)* |

If you are enabling Memory Defense, see `docs/developer/memory-defense/` for the policy schema, detector catalog, and audit trail.

:::tip Custom Authentication
For advanced authentication (JWT, OAuth, multi-tenant schemas), implement a custom `TenantExtension`. See the [Extensions documentation](./extensions.md) for details.
:::

### Server

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_HOST` | Bind address | `0.0.0.0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_PORT` | Server port | `8888` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_BASE_PATH` | Base path for API when behind reverse proxy (e.g., `/hindsight`) | `""` (root) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKERS` | Number of uvicorn worker processes | `1` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ACCESS_LOG` | Enable uvicorn access log (`true`, `1`, `yes`, `on` to enable) | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LOG_LEVEL` | Log level: `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error` | `info` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LOG_FORMAT` | Log format: `text` or `json` (structured logging for cloud platforms) | `text` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LOG_JSON_FIELDS` | Comma-separated allowlist of JSON log fields to emit (e.g. `severity,message,tenant`). Available: `severity`, `message`, `timestamp`, `logger`, `tenant`, `exception`. Empty = all fields. | `""` (all) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_ENABLED` | Enable MCP server at `/mcp/{bank_id}/` | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MODEL_INIT_TIMEOUT` | Wall-clock cap (seconds) on startup model/connection initialization. If embeddings, the cross-encoder, or LLM verification block (e.g. an offline model download or an unreachable provider), the server fails fast with a clear error instead of hanging forever. Increase if a legitimate first-time model download needs more time. | `300` |

### Retrieval

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_GRAPH_RETRIEVER` | Graph retrieval algorithm | `link_expansion` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LINK_EXPANSION_PER_ENTITY_LIMIT` | Max target units expanded per entity in `link_expansion` graph retrieval (LATERAL fanout cap per entity; bounds high-fanout entities). | `200` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LINK_EXPANSION_TIMEOUT` | Timeout (seconds) for the per-entity graph expansion query in `link_expansion` retrieval. | `10` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_MAX_CONCURRENT` | Max concurrent recall operations per worker (backpressure) | `32` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_CONNECTION_BUDGET` | Max concurrent DB connections per recall operation | `4` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_MAX_QUERY_TOKENS` | Maximum token length of a recall query. API requests exceeding this limit are rejected with HTTP 400; recalls that Hindsight runs internally (consolidation, reflect, MCP) truncate the query to the limit instead of failing. `0` disables the limit. | `500` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_QUERY_ANALYZER_LANGUAGES` | Restrict the locales `dateparser` considers when extracting temporal constraints from a recall query, as a comma-separated list of language codes (e.g. `en` or `en,zh`). Empty keeps full auto-detection across all supported locales. Restricting is significantly faster (auto-detection dominates recall's CPU cost) and avoids locale misdetection on a known-language corpus, but explicit dates written in an unlisted locale will then misparse rather than yield no constraint — only set this when you know which languages your queries use. Does not affect Chinese, which is handled before `dateparser` runs. | _(empty)_ |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_MAX_CANDIDATES` | Max candidates to rerank per recall (RRF pre-filters the rest) | `300` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_MAX_CANDIDATES_LOW` | Override the reranker candidate cap for `budget=low` recalls (the cross-encoder is the dominant cost of a large recall, so a lower cap trades some depth for latency). `0` falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_MAX_CANDIDATES`. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_MAX_CANDIDATES_MID` | Override the reranker candidate cap for `budget=mid` recalls. `0` falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_MAX_CANDIDATES`. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_MAX_CANDIDATES_HIGH` | Override the reranker candidate cap for `budget=high` recalls. `0` falls back to `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_MAX_CANDIDATES`. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_SEMANTIC_MIN_SIMILARITY` | Minimum cosine similarity a candidate must reach to be returned by the semantic retrieval strategy. Must be between `0` and `1`. | `0.3` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_GRAPH_SEED_MIN_SIMILARITY` | Minimum cosine similarity for a memory to seed graph retrieval. This is independent from the main semantic retrieval threshold. Must be between `0` and `1`. | `0.3` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_TEMPORAL_SEMANTIC_MIN_SIMILARITY` | Minimum cosine similarity for temporal retrieval entry points and spread neighbors. This is independent from the main semantic retrieval threshold. Must be between `0` and `1`. | `0.1` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_SEMANTIC_LINK_MIN_SIMILARITY` | Minimum cosine similarity for creating semantic links during normal retain, streaming retain, and graph-maintenance relinking. This directly controls semantic graph density. Must be between `0` and `1`. | `0.7` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_BM25_MIN_SCORE` | Minimum BM25 score a row must exceed to enter fusion. Gates out zero-score, non-matching rows on backends (notably `vchord`) whose operator ranks every document instead of pre-filtering to query-term matches. `0` keeps only genuine term matches; raise it to require stronger matches. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_MAX_CANDIDATES_PER_SOURCE` | Cap on candidates each retrieval source (semantic, BM25, graph, temporal) contributes to RRF, applied before the global reranker cap. Prevents one over-expanding backend from filling the reranker budget on its own. `0` disables the cap. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_STRATEGY_BOOSTS` | Prioritise one or more retrieval sources over the others on recall, as a comma-separated `strategy:level` list (e.g. `graph:high` to strongly favour graph hits, or `graph:high,bm25:low`). Strategies: `semantic`, `bm25`, `graph`, `temporal`. Levels: `low` (gentle — mainly protects the source's candidates from being dropped before reranking), `medium` (moderate preference), `high` (strong — the source dominates the candidate pool and outranks most other matches, only a strong direct match still wins). The boost is applied in two places: before the reranker cap (so favoured candidates survive the `HINDSIGHT_API_RERANKER_MAX_CANDIDATES` budget) and after reranking (to nudge them up the final order); a named level is used because those two stages live on different score scales. Only the strategies you list are boosted — any you omit keep their normal weight (no implicit boost). A strategy written without a level (`graph` or `graph:`) defaults to `medium`. Empty disables the feature. | _(empty)_ |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECENCY_DECAY_FUNCTION` | Shape of the recency boost applied during reranking — how a memory's age is turned into a small freshness adjustment to its final rank. `linear` (default) decays in a straight line from full freshness (today) to a floor reached at `HINDSIGHT_API_RECENCY_DECAY_LINEAR_WINDOW_DAYS`. `exponential` decays by half-life: a memory is treated as neutral (no boost or penalty) at `HINDSIGHT_API_RECENCY_DECAY_HALFLIFE_DAYS`, younger memories are boosted and older ones penalised, with a smooth fade rather than a hard cutoff. `none` disables recency entirely (age never affects ranking). | `linear` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECENCY_DECAY_LINEAR_WINDOW_DAYS` | For the `linear` decay function: the number of days over which a memory fades from full freshness to the minimum. Only used when `HINDSIGHT_API_RECENCY_DECAY_FUNCTION=linear`. | `365` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECENCY_DECAY_HALFLIFE_DAYS` | For the `exponential` decay function: the age (in days) at which a memory is considered neutral — younger memories get a recency boost, older ones a penalty. Smaller values favour very recent memories more aggressively. Only used when `HINDSIGHT_API_RECENCY_DECAY_FUNCTION=exponential`. | `90` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MENTAL_MODEL_REFRESH_CONCURRENCY` | Max concurrent mental model refreshes | `8` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_MENTAL_MODEL_HISTORY` | Track history of content changes to each mental model (previous content + timestamp), stored one row per change in the `mental_model_history` table. Set to `false` to disable entirely — no history rows are written, reducing storage if audit trails are not needed. **This is how you turn the feature off** (not a zero cap). | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MENTAL_MODEL_HISTORY_MAX_ENTRIES` | Max history rows kept per mental model. On each refresh the previous version is inserted into the `mental_model_history` table and the oldest rows beyond this cap are deleted, so per-model history can't grow without bound. `0` or a negative value **removes the cap** (history then grows with every refresh — unbounded); to turn history off entirely set `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_MENTAL_MODEL_HISTORY=false` instead. | `50` |

The five embedding-dependent gates—main semantic retrieval, graph seeds, temporal retrieval, semantic-link
construction, and observation deduplication—serve different precision/recall tradeoffs and are intentionally
configured independently. Their defaults preserve the behavior calibrated for `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`.
Changing embedding models can shift cosine-similarity distributions even when both models return normalized
vectors, so recalibrate all five values against their respective tasks before production use.

Changes to `HINDSIGHT_API_SEMANTIC_LINK_MIN_SIMILARITY` are not retroactive. The new value applies when new
semantic links are created during retain, streaming retain, or graph maintenance; maintenance does not remove
existing links below a raised threshold, and nodes that already have enough semantic links are not recomputed
when the threshold is lowered. To make an existing semantic graph fully conform to a new threshold, rebuild the
graph or re-ingest the source data into a new memory bank.

#### Graph Retrieval Algorithm

- **`link_expansion`** (default): Fast graph expansion from semantic seeds via entity co-occurrence, semantic kNN, and causal links. Target latency under 100ms.

#### Recall budget mapping

The recall request takes a `budget` parameter (`low` / `mid` / `high`, default `mid`) that maps to an integer `thinking_budget` used by every retrieval method (semantic, BM25, graph, temporal). These knobs control that mapping. They are hierarchical — overridable per bank via the [config API](#hierarchical-configuration).

Two functions are available:

- **`fixed`** (default — preserves legacy behavior): `thinking_budget = recall_budget_fixed_<level>` (independent of `max_tokens`).
- **`adaptive`**: `thinking_budget = round(max_tokens * recall_budget_adaptive_<level>)`, clamped to `[recall_budget_min, recall_budget_max]`. Useful when callers vary `max_tokens` and you want retrieval breadth to scale with the requested output size.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_BUDGET_FUNCTION` | Mapping function: `fixed` or `adaptive`. | `fixed` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_BUDGET_FIXED_LOW` | Items per retrieval method per fact type when `budget=low` and function is `fixed`. | `100` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_BUDGET_FIXED_MID` | Items per retrieval method per fact type when `budget=mid` and function is `fixed`. | `300` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_BUDGET_FIXED_HIGH` | Items per retrieval method per fact type when `budget=high` and function is `fixed`. | `1000` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_BUDGET_ADAPTIVE_LOW` | Ratio of request `max_tokens` used when `budget=low` and function is `adaptive`. | `0.025` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_BUDGET_ADAPTIVE_MID` | Ratio of request `max_tokens` used when `budget=mid` and function is `adaptive`. | `0.075` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_BUDGET_ADAPTIVE_HIGH` | Ratio of request `max_tokens` used when `budget=high` and function is `adaptive`. | `0.25` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_BUDGET_MIN` | Floor for the adaptive function (after clamping). | `20` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_BUDGET_MAX` | Ceiling for the adaptive function (after clamping). | `2000` |

#### Recall pipeline stages

Recall runs four retrieval arms (semantic, BM25, graph, temporal) and then reranks the
fused candidates with a cross-encoder. Each stage costs latency, and a bank whose content
has no relational or temporal structure pays for arms it cannot use — for example a bank
ingested with `retain_extraction_mode: chunks` and used as plain retrieval.

These switch the individual stages off. All are hierarchical — overridable per bank via the
[config API](#hierarchical-configuration) — so one bank can run lean without changing how the
rest of the deployment recalls. Semantic and BM25 always run; they are the baseline retrieval.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_TEMPORAL_EXTRACTION` | Run date-aware query analysis. `false` skips it and, with it, the temporal retrieval arm — without a detected constraint there is nothing to filter on. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_GRAPH_RETRIEVAL` | Run the entity/link graph traversal arm. `false` skips those queries and returns no graph results. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_RERANKING` | Rerank fused candidates with the cross-encoder. `false` returns the RRF-fused ordering directly — faster, but less precise. | `true` |

Turning all three off leaves semantic + BM25 fused by RRF, which is the lowest-latency
recall configuration.

##### Pairing with the retain side: plain-retrieval ("RAG") banks

These recall toggles only remove work from the *read* path. If a bank is being used as
plain retrieval, the ingestion path should be configured to match — otherwise it still
pays for LLM work whose output recall no longer uses:

- **`retain_extraction_mode: chunks`** skips LLM fact extraction entirely and stores each
  chunk as-is. This returns before any LLM queue or lock is acquired, so it removes the
  LLM call from retain rather than just shortening it — normally the dominant cost of
  ingestion.
- **`enable_observations: false`** skips consolidation, the other background LLM workload.

Configured together, the bank behaves like a conventional vector store: chunks in, hybrid
search out, no LLM on either path. Set both sides in one call:

```bash
curl -X PUT "$HINDSIGHT_API_URL/v1/default/banks/my-bank" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HINDSIGHT_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "retain_extraction_mode": "chunks",
    "enable_observations": false,
    "enable_temporal_extraction": false,
    "enable_graph_retrieval": false,
    "enable_reranking": false
  }'
```

The trade-off is the point of the product: no extracted facts, entities, or links means no
graph or temporal structure to retrieve, and no mental models to reflect over. Use it for
banks that are genuinely plain retrieval — or to benchmark Hindsight against a baseline
vector store on equal terms — not as a general latency fix.

### Retain

Controls the retain (memory ingestion) pipeline.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS` | Max completion tokens for fact extraction LLM calls | `64000` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_CHUNK_SIZE` | Max characters per chunk for fact extraction. Larger chunks extract fewer LLM calls but may lose context. | `3000` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_STRUCTURED_CHUNK_SIZE` | Max characters for a single JSONL line or conversation turn to keep whole. Unset uses `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_CHUNK_SIZE`. Must be a positive integer when set. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE` | Fact extraction mode: `concise`, `verbose`, `verbatim`, `chunks`, or `custom` | `concise` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_MISSION` | What this bank should pay attention to during extraction. Steers the LLM without replacing the extraction rules — works alongside any extraction mode. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS` | Full prompt override for fact extraction (only used when mode is `custom`). Replaces built-in extraction rules entirely. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACT_CAUSAL_LINKS` | Extract causal relationships between facts | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_BATCH_ENABLED` | Use LLM Batch API for fact extraction (50% cost savings, only with async operations) | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_MAX_CONCURRENT` | Max concurrent retain DB phases (HNSW reads + writes). Limits I/O contention during high-concurrency ingestion. | `4` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_WALL_TIMEOUT` | Wall-clock ceiling in seconds for one retain task in the worker. A retain that blocks indefinitely (lock contention, an unreachable LLM endpoint) is cancelled and marked `failed` instead of holding its worker slot until the process restarts, so it can be retried. Set well above your slowest healthy retain; `0` disables. | `3600` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_BATCH_TOKENS` | Max characters per sub-batch for async retain auto-splitting | `10000` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_CHUNK_BATCH_SIZE` | Max chunks per streaming batch when retain ingests long documents. Each chunk produces roughly 17 facts, so the default 100 chunks ≈ 1700 facts per batch. Lower to cap memory/LLM pressure on large documents; raise for smaller chunks. Configurable per bank. | `100` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_ENTITY_LOOKUP` | Entity lookup method during retain: `full` (exact match) or `trigram` (fuzzy trigram matching) | `trigram` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_ENTITY_RESOLUTION_BATCH_SIZE` | Max unique entity names per fuzzy candidate lookup query (`trigram` on PG, `oracle_fuzzy` on Oracle). Bounds query size so very wide retain batches don't time out a single `unnest(...)` join on banks with many entities. | `100` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_DEFAULT_STRATEGY` | Default retain strategy name. When set, all retain calls without an explicit `strategy` parameter use this strategy. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_BATCH_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | Batch API polling interval in seconds | `60` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_STORE_DOCUMENT_TEXT` | Persist the raw source text alongside extracted memories. Set to `false` to skip storing it (`documents.original_text` NULL, `chunks.chunk_text` empty). Hierarchical — overridable per bank via the [config API](#hierarchical-configuration), so a data-minimizing bank can keep only derived facts while others retain the raw source. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FAIL_ON_EXTRACTION_ERRORS` | When `true`, a retain operation that accumulated any fact-extraction errors is marked `failed` (with an error message including the count) instead of `completed`, so silently-dropped facts surface as a hard failure. Default preserves existing behavior. Static, server-level. | `false` |

> **Batch-capable providers.** `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_BATCH_ENABLED=true` only works with a retain LLM provider that implements a batch API: `openai`, `groq`, `gemini`, and `fireworks`. Batch always requires async retain (`async=true`); a sync retain with batch enabled errors. Other providers fail fast at startup.

> **Gemini** uses the [Gemini Batch API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/batch-api) (flat 50% input + output discount, 24h SLA — typically minutes). It needs no extra settings beyond `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_BATCH_ENABLED=true` and an API-key `gemini` provider; Vertex AI (`vertexai`) is not batch-capable.

#### Fireworks batch inference

Fireworks AI's batch API is **not** OpenAI `/v1/batches`-compatible — it is a proprietary, account-scoped dataset/job workflow on a separate control-plane host (`https://api.fireworks.ai`), distinct from the OpenAI-compatible inference host (`https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1`). Hindsight adapts it transparently, so enabling batch is the same as any other provider plus one required setting: your Fireworks **account id**. (This is separate from the existing LiteLLM `fireworks_ai/...` online path, which is unaffected.)

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID` | Fireworks account id. **Required** for `fireworks` batch retain — the control-plane endpoints are `/v1/accounts/{account_id}/...`. Static, server-level. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FIREWORKS_BATCH_BASE_URL` | Fireworks batch control-plane host. | `https://api.fireworks.ai` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FIREWORKS_BATCH_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS` | Max time to wait for a batch job before surfacing a failure. Guards against the Fireworks gotcha where a non-batch-eligible model leaves the job `PENDING` forever. | `86400` (24h) |

```bash
# Fireworks batch retain (50% cost savings, async only)
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_PROVIDER=fireworks
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_API_KEY=fw_xxxxxxxxxxxx
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_LLM_MODEL=accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3p1-8b-instruct
export HINDSIGHT_API_FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_BATCH_ENABLED=true
```

> **Entity labels** (`entity_labels`) and **free-form entity extraction** (`entities_allow_free_form`) are configured per bank via the [bank config API](/developer/api/memory-banks#retain-configuration), not as global environment variables — each bank can have its own controlled vocabulary. See [Entity Labels](/developer/retain#entity-labels) for details.

#### Skip storing raw document text

By default Hindsight keeps a verbatim copy of everything you retain so you can later read the source, re-process a document, or export it. For deployments that only want to keep the extracted memories (facts, entities, mental models) and not the source text, set:

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_STORE_DOCUMENT_TEXT=false
```

When disabled, the full retain pipeline still runs — chunking, fact extraction, embedding, and entity linking are unchanged, so **memory quality and recall are not affected** (recall reads from the extracted memories, never from the raw text). The difference is purely what gets persisted:

- `documents.original_text` is stored as `NULL` instead of the raw payload.
- The raw chunk text is dropped (stored as empty), while the chunk's content hash is still kept so incremental re-retain of the same document continues to deduplicate correctly.

**`update_mode="append"` is rejected when text storage is disabled.** Append rebuilds a document by reading back its previously stored text and adding to it. With nothing stored, appending would silently drop the prior content, so an append retain returns an error instead. Use `update_mode="replace"` (the default).

**Features that degrade when text storage is disabled** (because they read the source text back):

- **Document export** carries no source text; re-importing such a bank cannot re-run extraction from the original payload.
- **Reading a document's source** (the get-document, list-chunks, and get-chunk endpoints, including their MCP equivalents) returns empty content.
- **Recall with `include_chunks=true`** returns empty `chunk_text` — the facts themselves are unaffected, but the surrounding source-chunk context is no longer available.
- **Reflect** no longer offers the `expand` tool (which fetches a memory's source chunk/document), and its `recall` step stops attaching source chunks, since there is no stored text to return. Reflection over the extracted memories is otherwise unaffected.
- **Reprocessing a document** from its stored text is a no-op (there is nothing to reprocess).

This is a static, server-level setting and cannot be overridden per bank.

#### Customizing retain: when to use what

There are five levels of customization for the retain pipeline. Start with the simplest that covers your needs:

| Goal | Use |
|------|-----|
| Steer what topics to focus on or deprioritize | `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_MISSION` |
| Extract more detail per fact | `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE=verbose` |
| Store chunks as-is, LLM extracts metadata | `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE=verbatim` |
| Store chunks as-is, zero LLM cost | `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE=chunks` |
| Completely replace the extraction rules | `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE=custom` + `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS` |

**`HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_MISSION` — steer extraction without replacing it (recommended starting point)**

Tell the bank what to pay attention to during extraction, in plain language. The mission is injected into the extraction prompt alongside the built-in rules — it narrows focus without replacing the underlying logic. Works with any extraction mode (`concise`, `verbose`, `verbatim`, `custom`). Ignored in `chunks` mode.

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_MISSION="Focus on technical decisions, architecture choices, and team member expertise. Deprioritize social or personal information."
```

**`HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE=verbose` — more detail per fact**

Use when you need richer facts with full context, relationships, and verbosity. Slower and uses more tokens than `concise`.

**`HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE=verbatim` — store chunks as-is**

Each chunk is stored as a single memory unit with its original text preserved exactly — no summarization or rewriting. The LLM still runs to extract entities, temporal information, and location so the chunk is fully indexed and retrievable. Useful for RAG-style indexing, document ingestion pipelines, or benchmarks where you want the original text in memory rather than LLM-generated summaries.

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE=verbatim
```

**`retain_strategies` / `retain_default_strategy` — per-call extraction strategy**

Named strategies let you ingest different content types into the same bank using different extraction settings. A strategy is a set of hierarchical field overrides applied on top of the resolved bank config.

Any field in the hierarchical config can be overridden per strategy, including `retain_extraction_mode`, `retain_chunk_size`, `retain_structured_chunk_size`, `entity_labels`, `entities_allow_free_form`, `retain_mission`, etc.

Configure strategies via the bank config API:

```json
{
  "retain_default_strategy": "conversations",
  "retain_strategies": {
    "conversations": {
      "retain_extraction_mode": "concise",
      "retain_chunk_size": 3000,
      "retain_structured_chunk_size": 12000
    },
    "documents": {
      "retain_extraction_mode": "chunks",
      "retain_chunk_size": 800,
      "entity_labels": null,
      "entities_allow_free_form": false
    }
  }
}
```

Then specify the strategy at retain time:

```python
# Uses default strategy ("conversations")
client.retain(bank_id, items=[{"content": "Alice joined the team today"}])

# Explicitly use document strategy
client.retain(bank_id, items=[{"content": "...document text..."}], strategy="documents")
```

If no `strategy` is specified in a retain call, `retain_default_strategy` is used. If neither is set, the bank/global config applies directly.

**`HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE=chunks` — zero LLM cost**

Each chunk is stored as-is with no LLM call whatsoever. No entity extraction, no temporal indexing — only embeddings are generated for semantic search. User-provided entities passed via `RetainContent.entities` are the sole source of entity data. Use when ingestion speed and cost matter more than structured metadata.

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE=chunks
```

**`HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE=custom` + `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS` — full control**

Replaces the built-in selectivity rules entirely. The structural parts of the prompt (output format, temporal handling, coreference resolution) remain intact — only the extraction guidelines are replaced.

Use this when `retain_mission` isn't sufficient and you need strict inclusion/exclusion logic.

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE=custom
export HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS="ONLY extract facts that are:
✅ Technical decisions and their rationale
✅ Architecture patterns and design choices
✅ Performance metrics and benchmarks

DO NOT extract:
❌ Greetings or social conversation
❌ Process chatter (\"let me check\", \"one moment\")
❌ Anything that would not be useful in 6 months"
```

### File Processing

Configuration for the file upload and conversion pipeline (used by `POST /v1/default/banks/{bank_id}/files/retain`).

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_FILE_UPLOAD_API` | Enable the file upload API endpoint | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_DOCUMENT_EXPORT_API` | Enable the [document export](./api/memory-banks.mdx#document-export--import) endpoint (`GET /document-transfer`) | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_DOCUMENT_IMPORT_API` | Enable the [document import](./api/memory-banks.mdx#document-export--import) endpoint (`POST /document-transfer`) | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER` | Server-side default parser or fallback chain (comma-separated, e.g. `iris,markitdown`) | `markitdown` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_ALLOWLIST` | Comma-separated list of parsers clients are allowed to request. If not set, all registered parsers are allowed. | — |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_CONVERSION_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` | Max files per upload request | `10` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_CONVERSION_MAX_BATCH_SIZE_MB` | Max total upload size per request (MB) | `100` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_DELETE_AFTER_RETAIN` | Delete stored files after memory extraction completes | `true` |

#### Parser selection

Clients can override the server default by passing `parser` in the request body of `POST /v1/default/banks/{bank_id}/files/retain`. Both the server default and the per-request field accept a single parser name or an ordered **fallback chain** — each parser is tried in sequence until one succeeds.

```bash
# Server default: try iris first, fall back to markitdown if iris fails
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER=iris,markitdown

# Restrict what clients may request (optional — defaults to all registered parsers)
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_ALLOWLIST=markitdown,iris
```

```json
// Per-request override (in the JSON body of the file retain endpoint)
{
  "parser": "iris",
  "files_metadata": [
    { "document_id": "report" },
    { "document_id": "fallback_doc", "parser": ["iris", "markitdown"] }
  ]
}
```

Clients that request a parser not in the allowlist receive HTTP 400.

#### Parser: markitdown (default)

Local file-to-markdown conversion using [Microsoft's markitdown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown). No external service is required by default.

**Supported formats:** PDF, DOCX, DOC, PPTX, PPT, XLSX, XLS, images (JPG, PNG — requires optional OCR for text extraction), audio (MP3, WAV — transcription), HTML, TXT, MD, CSV.

For image workloads, MarkItDown can optionally use an OpenAI-compatible OCR/vision endpoint. This is disabled by default. Without it, image uploads fail with an actionable configuration error instead of low-level parser output. When enabled, configure the MarkItDown OCR API key, base URL, and model explicitly; they do not inherit from `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_*` because MarkItDown uses the OpenAI SDK directly. The selected endpoint must implement OpenAI Chat Completions and the selected model must support image input.

This OCR path uses MarkItDown's image converter hook. It applies to image inputs such as JPG and PNG (and image handling inside converters that consume MarkItDown's `llm_client`), but it does not rasterize scanned PDF pages into images. Scanned PDFs with no text layer may still extract poorly through the default PDF converter. For scanned PDFs or complex document layouts, use an OCR-capable document parser such as `iris` or `llama_parse`, or configure a parser fallback chain like `llama_parse,markitdown`.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_MARKITDOWN_OCR_ENABLED` | Enable MarkItDown image OCR through an OpenAI-compatible OCR/vision endpoint | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_MARKITDOWN_OCR_API_KEY` | API key for MarkItDown OCR; required when OCR is enabled | — |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_MARKITDOWN_OCR_BASE_URL` | OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions base URL for MarkItDown OCR; required when OCR is enabled | — |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_MARKITDOWN_OCR_MODEL` | OCR/vision model with image-input support; required when OCR is enabled | — |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_MARKITDOWN_OCR_PROMPT` | OCR prompt passed to MarkItDown's image converter | Built-in OCR prompt |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_MARKITDOWN_OCR_DEFAULT_HEADERS` | Optional JSON dict passed as `default_headers` to the OCR OpenAI SDK client (proxies / request-tracing middleware) | `null` |

```bash
# Configure a dedicated OpenAI-compatible OCR/vision endpoint for MarkItDown OCR
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER=markitdown
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_MARKITDOWN_OCR_ENABLED=true
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_MARKITDOWN_OCR_API_KEY=your-vision-api-key
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_MARKITDOWN_OCR_BASE_URL=https://vision.example/v1
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_MARKITDOWN_OCR_MODEL=ocr-or-vision-model
# Optional custom headers for proxies / request tracing
# export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_MARKITDOWN_OCR_DEFAULT_HEADERS='{"X-Component-Id":"hindsight-ocr"}'
```

#### Parser: iris

Cloud-based extraction via [Vectorize Iris](https://docs.vectorize.io/build-deploy/extract-information/understanding-iris/). Higher quality extraction for complex documents, powered by a remote AI service.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_IRIS_TOKEN` | Vectorize API token | — |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_IRIS_ORG_ID` | Vectorize organization ID | — |

**Supported formats:** PDF, DOCX, DOC, PPTX, PPT, XLSX, XLS, images (JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WEBP), HTML, TXT, MD, CSV.

```bash
# Use iris as the only parser
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER=iris
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_IRIS_TOKEN=your-vectorize-token
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_IRIS_ORG_ID=your-org-id

# Or: try iris first, fall back to markitdown if iris fails or rejects the file type
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER=iris,markitdown
```

#### Parser: llama_parse

Cloud-based extraction via [LlamaParse](https://docs.cloud.llamaindex.ai/llamaparse) (LlamaIndex). Strong extraction for complex layouts — tables, charts, multi-column PDFs.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_LLAMA_PARSE_API_KEY` | LlamaCloud API key (typically starts with `llx-`) | — |

**Supported formats:** PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, HTML, EPUB, RTF, TXT, and many more — see the [LlamaParse docs](https://docs.cloud.llamaindex.ai/llamaparse/features/supported_document_types) for the full list.

```bash
# Use llama_parse as the only parser
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER=llama_parse
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER_LLAMA_PARSE_API_KEY=llx-your-api-key

# Or: try llama_parse first, fall back to markitdown
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_PARSER=llama_parse,markitdown
```

```bash
# Increase batch limits for large file imports
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_CONVERSION_MAX_BATCH_SIZE=20
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_CONVERSION_MAX_BATCH_SIZE_MB=500

# Keep files after processing (useful for debugging or re-processing)
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_DELETE_AFTER_RETAIN=false
```

### File Storage

Files uploaded via the file retain API are stored in an object storage backend before conversion. Choose the backend that fits your infrastructure.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_TYPE` | Storage backend: `native`, `s3`, `gcs`, or `azure` | `native` |

#### Native (PostgreSQL)

Files are stored as `BYTEA` in the `file_storage` table. No additional infrastructure required. Suitable for development and small deployments.

```bash
# Native storage is the default — no additional configuration needed
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_TYPE=native
```

#### S3 / S3-Compatible

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET` | S3 bucket name | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_REGION` | AWS region | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_ENDPOINT` | Custom endpoint URL (for S3-compatible stores like MinIO, Cloudflare R2, Tigris) | AWS default |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | AWS access key ID | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | AWS secret access key | - |

For S3-compatible providers that don't expose AWS-style regions (MinIO, Cloudflare R2, Tigris), set `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_REGION=auto`. The value is required for SigV4 request signing but is ignored by the service.

```bash
# AWS S3
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_TYPE=s3
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET=my-hindsight-files
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_REGION=us-east-1
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

# S3-compatible (MinIO, Cloudflare R2, etc.)
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_TYPE=s3
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET=my-bucket
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_REGION=auto
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_ENDPOINT=https://your-minio.example.com
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=minioadmin
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin

# Tigris (S3-compatible, single global endpoint)
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_TYPE=s3
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET=my-hindsight-bucket
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_REGION=auto
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_ENDPOINT=https://t3.storage.dev
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=tid_your_access_key
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=tsec_your_secret_key
```

#### Google Cloud Storage

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_GCS_BUCKET` | GCS bucket name | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_GCS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` | Path to service account JSON key file | ADC if not set |

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_TYPE=gcs
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_GCS_BUCKET=my-hindsight-files
# Optional: use service account key file (otherwise falls back to ADC)
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_GCS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=/path/to/key.json
```

#### Azure Blob Storage

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_AZURE_CONTAINER` | Azure container name | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME` | Azure storage account name | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_AZURE_ACCOUNT_KEY` | Azure storage account key | - |

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_TYPE=azure
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_AZURE_CONTAINER=hindsight-files
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME=mystorageaccount
export HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_STORAGE_AZURE_ACCOUNT_KEY=base64encodedkey==
```

#### Storage Backend Comparison

| Backend | Best For | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| `native` | Development, small deployments | No extra infrastructure, stored in PostgreSQL |
| `s3` | Production, AWS deployments | Works with any S3-compatible store |
| `gcs` | Production, GCP deployments | Supports ADC for keyless auth |
| `azure` | Production, Azure deployments | Uses account key auth |

:::tip Production Recommendation
For production deployments, use `s3`, `gcs`, or `azure` to avoid storing large binary files in your PostgreSQL database. Set `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_DELETE_AFTER_RETAIN=true` (the default) to delete files after memory extraction, which minimizes storage costs.
:::

### Observations (Experimental) {#observations}

Observations are deduplicated, evidence-grounded knowledge consolidated from multiple facts. Each observation tracks its supporting memories and a proof count, and is refined — not overwritten — when new evidence arrives.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_OBSERVATIONS` | Enable observation consolidation | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_AUTO_CONSOLIDATION` | Automatically trigger consolidation after retain, delete, and update operations. When `false`, consolidation only runs when explicitly triggered via the [consolidate endpoint](/developer/api/operations#consolidation). Configurable per bank. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_RECONCILE_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | Interval for the background sweep that re-schedules consolidation for banks with unconsolidated facts but no consolidation in progress — recovering facts left unscheduled when a consolidation operation failed terminally (e.g. the LLM provider was unavailable). Only applies to banks with auto-consolidation enabled. `0` disables the sweep. | `300` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MENTAL_MODEL_REFRESH_TICK_SECONDS` | How often the background loop checks for cron-scheduled mental models that are due for a refresh. This is only the *check* cadence; the actual schedule is the per-model `trigger.refresh_cron` expression set on the mental model. A due model is refreshed only when it is stale (new memories in its scope since the last refresh). `0` disables the sweep. | `60` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_OBSERVATION_HISTORY` | Track history of changes to each observation (previous text/tags/dates + timestamp), stored one row per change in the `observation_history` table. Set to `false` to disable entirely — no history rows are written. **This is how you turn the feature off** (not a zero cap). | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_OBSERVATION_HISTORY_MAX_ENTRIES` | Max history rows kept per observation. On each update the previous version is inserted into the `observation_history` table and the oldest rows beyond this cap are deleted, so an often-reinforced observation's history can't grow without bound. `0` or a negative value **removes the cap** (unbounded); to turn history off entirely set `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_OBSERVATION_HISTORY=false` instead. | `50` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | Outer retry attempts for the consolidation LLM batch call. Each attempt uses the inner retry budget (`HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_LLM_MAX_RETRIES`). Worst-case API calls per batch = `MAX_ATTEMPTS × (LLM_MAX_RETRIES + 1)`. | `3` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_BATCH_SIZE` | Memories to load per batch (internal optimization) | `50` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_MAX_MEMORIES_PER_ROUND` | Maximum memories processed per consolidation round. When the limit is reached, the job yields its worker slot and re-queues itself so other banks get fair scheduling. Mental model refreshes only run on the final round. `0` = unlimited. Configurable per bank. | `100` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_MAX_TOKENS` | Max tokens for recall when finding related observations during consolidation | `1024` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS` | Max completion tokens requested for each consolidation LLM batch call. Unset by default, so each provider keeps its implicit output budget. Set this when a provider applies a low hidden cap (e.g. Bedrock imported models) that truncates consolidation output. | `unset` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_LLM_BATCH_SIZE` | Number of facts sent to the LLM in a single consolidation call. Higher values reduce LLM calls and improve throughput at the cost of larger prompts. Set to `1` to disable batching. Configurable per bank. | `8` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_DEDUP_THRESHOLD` | Cosine similarity at/above which a newly-created or freshly-updated observation is reconciled against an existing near-identical one via a focused 1-by-1 LLM "merge or keep" call (the model reads both texts, so a number/negation/entity difference is respected). Catches near-duplicate observations that weaker consolidation models emit even when shown the twin, as well as duplicates that arise when an update rewrites an observation into a near-twin of another. Set to `1.0` to disable. Postgres only — consolidation skips reconciliation on Oracle regardless of this value. | `0.97` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_LLM_PARALLELISM` | Maximum number of tag groups consolidated concurrently within one consolidation op. Each group acquires per-scope locks before processing, so groups whose write scopes overlap (e.g. under `per_tag` / `all_combinations` / explicit-list `observation_scopes`) automatically serialise on the overlapping scopes — actual concurrency may be lower than this cap when scopes contend. Set to `1` for fully sequential behaviour. Higher values raise peak LLM QPS and connection-pool usage during consolidation proportionally — tune down if your LLM provider rate-limits tightly or your DB pool is small. Configurable per bank. | `4` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_RECALL_BUDGET` | Budget level for the recall pass inside consolidation (`low`, `mid`, `high`). Lower budgets fetch fewer candidate rows, reducing peak memory usage on large banks. | `low` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_SOURCE_FACTS_MAX_TOKENS` | Total token budget for source facts included with observations in the consolidation prompt. `-1` = unlimited. Configurable per bank. | `4096` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_CONSOLIDATION_SOURCE_FACTS_MAX_TOKENS_PER_OBSERVATION` | Per-observation token cap for source facts in the consolidation prompt. Each observation independently gets at most this many tokens of source facts. `-1` = unlimited. Configurable per bank. | `256` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_OBSERVATIONS_MISSION` | What this bank should synthesise into durable observations. Replaces the built-in consolidation rules — leave unset to use the server default. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MAX_OBSERVATIONS_PER_SCOPE` | Maximum number of observations allowed per tag scope. When the limit is reached, consolidation will only update or delete existing observations — no new ones are created. Applies per tag scope (e.g., per-tag when using `per_tag` observation scopes). Observations with no tags are not subject to this limit. `-1` = unlimited. Configurable per bank. | `-1` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_OBSERVATION_SCOPE_LIMITS` | Per-scope overrides of `MAX_OBSERVATIONS_PER_SCOPE`, as a JSON array of `{"scope": [tag-globs], "limit": int}` rules. Each `scope` is a list of [fnmatch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html) globs; a consolidation scope matches under *exact cover* — every tag must be matched by a glob and every glob must match a tag, so `["shared"]` matches the scope `{shared}` but not `{run_1, shared}`. The first matching rule wins; scopes that match no rule fall back to `MAX_OBSERVATIONS_PER_SCOPE`. Example: `[{"scope": ["shared"], "limit": -1}, {"scope": ["run_*", "shared"], "limit": 50}]` keeps the `{shared}` scope unlimited while capping each `{run_*, shared}` scope at 50. Configurable per bank. | - |

#### Customizing observations: when to use what

| Goal | Use |
|------|-----|
| Default behavior: durable specific facts, no ephemeral state | Leave unset |
| Change what observations *are* for this bank (different shape, different purpose) | `HINDSIGHT_API_OBSERVATIONS_MISSION` |

**`HINDSIGHT_API_OBSERVATIONS_MISSION` — redefine what this bank synthesises**

By default, observations are durable, specific beliefs consolidated from memories — the kind of knowledge that stays true over time (preferences, skills, relationships, recurring patterns). Each one is grounded in the source memories that support it. Ephemeral state is filtered out. Contradictions are tracked with temporal markers rather than overwriting the prior belief.

Set `HINDSIGHT_API_OBSERVATIONS_MISSION` to replace this definition entirely. Write a plain-language description of what observations should be for your use case. The LLM will use this instead of the default rules when deciding what to create or update. Leave it unset to keep the server default.

:::tip When to use observations_mission
Use it when the default durable-knowledge behavior doesn't match your use case. Common scenarios:
- You want **broader event summaries** rather than isolated facts
- You want observations **grouped by time period** (weekly, monthly)
- You want a **different granularity** (one observation per project rather than per fact)
- You have a **domain-specific** notion of what's worth remembering
:::

**Example: Weekly event summaries**

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_OBSERVATIONS_MISSION="Observations are broad summaries of project events grouped by week. Each observation should capture what happened, what was decided, and what was blocked — not individual facts. Merge related events into cohesive weekly narratives."
```

**Example: Person-centric knowledge**

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_OBSERVATIONS_MISSION="Observations are durable facts about specific named people: their preferences, skills, relationships, and behavioral patterns. Only create observations for facts that are stable over time and tied to a named individual."
```

**Example: Support ticket patterns**

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_OBSERVATIONS_MISSION="Observations are recurring patterns in customer support interactions: common failure modes, frequently requested features, and pain points that appear across multiple tickets."
```

### Reflect

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_MAX_ITERATIONS` | Max tool call iterations before forcing a response | `10` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` | Max accumulated context tokens in the reflect loop before forcing final synthesis. Prevents `context_length_exceeded` errors on large banks. Lower this if your LLM has a context window smaller than 128K. | `100000` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_WALL_TIMEOUT` | Wall-clock timeout in seconds for the entire reflect operation. If exceeded, the request returns HTTP 504. | `300` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_MISSION` | Global reflect mission (identity and reasoning framing). Overridden per bank via config API. | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_REFLECT_SOURCE_FACTS_MAX_TOKENS` | Token budget for source facts in `search_observations` during reflect. `-1` disables source facts (default), `0` enables with no limit, `>0` enables with a token budget. Hierarchical — can be overridden per bank via config API. | `-1` |

#### Internal recall (used by mental model refresh)

These knobs control the recall tool that runs inside `reflect_async` (e.g. when refreshing a mental model). They are hierarchical — overridable per bank via the config API, and individually overridable per mental model via the `trigger.include_chunks`, `trigger.recall_max_tokens`, and `trigger.recall_chunks_max_tokens` fields.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_INCLUDE_CHUNKS` | Whether the internal recall returns raw chunk text alongside facts. Set `false` to skip chunks and save prompt budget. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_MAX_TOKENS` | Token budget for facts returned by the internal recall. | `2048` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_RECALL_CHUNKS_MAX_TOKENS` | Token budget for raw chunks returned by the internal recall. | `1000` |

#### Disposition

Disposition traits control how the bank reasons during reflect operations. Each trait is on a scale of 1–5. These are hierarchical — they can be overridden per bank via the [config API](./configuration.md#hierarchical-configuration).

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DISPOSITION_SKEPTICISM` | How skeptical vs trusting (1=trusting, 5=skeptical) | `3` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DISPOSITION_LITERALISM` | How literally to interpret information (1=flexible, 5=literal) | `3` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DISPOSITION_EMPATHY` | How much to consider emotional context (1=detached, 5=empathetic) | `3` |

### MCP Server

Configuration for MCP server endpoints.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_ENABLED` | Enable MCP server at `/mcp/{bank_id}/` | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_ENABLED_TOOLS` | Comma-separated allowlist of MCP tools to expose globally (empty = all tools) | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_STATELESS` | Use stateless HTTP transport (POST-only). When `false`, enables stateful mode with GET/SSE support for server-initiated messages | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` | Bearer token for MCP authentication (optional) | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_LOCAL_BANK_ID` | Memory bank ID for local MCP | `mcp` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_INSTRUCTIONS` | Additional instructions appended to retain/recall tool descriptions | - |

**Tool Access Control:**

`HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_ENABLED_TOOLS` restricts which MCP tools are registered at the server level. This is useful for read-only deployments or limiting surface area:

```bash
# Expose only recall (read-only deployment)
export HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_ENABLED_TOOLS=recall

# Expose recall and reflect only
export HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_ENABLED_TOOLS=recall,reflect
```

Available tool names: `retain`, `recall`, `reflect`, `list_banks`, `create_bank`, `list_mental_models`, `get_mental_model`, `create_mental_model`, `update_mental_model`, `delete_mental_model`, `refresh_mental_model`, `list_directives`, `create_directive`, `delete_directive`, `list_memories`, `get_memory`, `list_documents`, `get_document`, `delete_document`, `list_operations`, `get_operation`, `cancel_operation`, `list_tags`, `get_bank`, `get_bank_stats`, `update_bank`, `delete_bank`, `clear_memories`.

This can also be overridden per bank via the [config API](#hierarchical-configuration):

```bash
# Restrict a specific bank to read-only MCP access
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8888/v1/default/banks/my-bank/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"updates": {"mcp_enabled_tools": ["recall"]}}'
```

When a bank-level `mcp_enabled_tools` is set, tools not in the list return a clear error when invoked (they still appear in the tools list for MCP protocol compatibility).

**MCP Authentication:**

By default, the MCP endpoint is open. For production deployments, set `HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` to require Bearer token authentication:

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=your-secret-token
```

Clients must then include the token in the `Authorization` header. See [MCP Server documentation](./mcp-server.md#authentication) for details.

**Local MCP instructions:**

```bash
# Example: instruct MCP to also store assistant actions
export HINDSIGHT_API_MCP_INSTRUCTIONS="Also store every action you take, including tool calls and decisions made."
```

### Distributed Workers

Configuration for background task processing. By default, the API processes tasks internally. For high-throughput deployments, run dedicated workers. See [Services - Worker Service](./services#worker-service) for details.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_ENABLED` | Enable internal worker in API process | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_ID` | Unique worker identifier | hostname |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | Database polling interval in milliseconds | `500` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_MAX_RETRIES` | Max retries before marking task failed | `3` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_TASK_RETRY_BACKOFF_SECONDS` | Seconds between retries on transient task failure | `60` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_HTTP_PORT` | HTTP port for worker metrics/health (worker CLI only) | `8889` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_MAX_SLOTS` | Maximum concurrent tasks per worker (total across all operation types) | `10` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_OPERATION_RETENTION_DAYS` | Static server-wide retention window for completed, failed, and cancelled operation rows, including their task payload and result metadata. `0` (the default) keeps them indefinitely; set a positive number of days to enable automatic pruning. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_OPERATION_CLEANUP_BATCH_SIZE` | Maximum expired terminal operation rows deleted per tenant schema during each cleanup cycle. The cleanup job runs once per maintenance tick, so this also sets the drain rate for a backlog. Must be a positive integer. | `1000` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_CONSOLIDATION_RESERVED_SLOTS` | Reserved (minimum) slots for consolidation within `WORKER_MAX_SLOTS` — a floor that guarantees capacity, **not** a per-type cap (bank-serialization preserved). See the note below. | `2` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_CONSOLIDATION_BANK_PRIORITY` | Per-bank priority for consolidation scheduling (see note below) | _(unset)_ |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_RETAIN_RESERVED_SLOTS` | Reserved (minimum) slots for retain within `WORKER_MAX_SLOTS`. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_FILE_CONVERT_RETAIN_RESERVED_SLOTS` | Reserved (minimum) slots for file_convert_retain within `WORKER_MAX_SLOTS`. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_REFRESH_MENTAL_MODEL_RESERVED_SLOTS` | Reserved (minimum) slots for refresh_mental_model within `WORKER_MAX_SLOTS`. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_GRAPH_MAINTENANCE_RESERVED_SLOTS` | Reserved (minimum) slots for graph_maintenance within `WORKER_MAX_SLOTS`. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_IMPORT_DOCUMENTS_RESERVED_SLOTS` | Reserved (minimum) slots for import_documents within `WORKER_MAX_SLOTS`. | `0` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_<TYPE>_MAX_SLOTS` | **Deprecated** alias for `..._RESERVED_SLOTS`, where `<TYPE>` is one of `CONSOLIDATION`, `RETAIN`, `FILE_CONVERT_RETAIN`, `REFRESH_MENTAL_MODEL`, `GRAPH_MAINTENANCE`, `IMPORT_DOCUMENTS`. The name is misleading — it always set the reservation floor, never a ceiling. Still honored but logs a warning; will be removed in a future release. Setting both it and `..._RESERVED_SLOTS` is an error. | _(unset)_ |

Terminal operations use one coherent retention window for the entire row. Hindsight does not scrub the task payload when an operation finishes: failed and cancelled operations need it for retry, while `include_payload=true` on completed operations is an explicit debugging surface. Keeping payload, result metadata, progress, and status together also avoids partial operation histories. Once a terminal row's `updated_at` is older than the configured window, the background maintenance loop prunes it in bounded per-schema batches, alongside the other scheduled sweeps. PostgreSQL only — the maintenance loop does not run on Oracle. Pending and processing rows are never pruned by this cleanup.

:::note Worker slot reservations are a floor, not a cap
`..._RESERVED_SLOTS` reserves a guaranteed *minimum* number of slots (a floor) for an operation type within `WORKER_MAX_SLOTS`, so a saturated pool can't starve it. It is **not** a per-type maximum. The sum of all reservations must not exceed `WORKER_MAX_SLOTS` (startup raises `ValueError` otherwise). Remaining capacity (`WORKER_MAX_SLOTS - sum of reservations`) forms a **shared pool** usable by any type on a first-come basis, and a type whose reservation is full **overflows into the shared pool** — so a type's real ceiling is `WORKER_MAX_SLOTS`, regardless of its reservation.

Example: `MAX_SLOTS=10`, `CONSOLIDATION_RESERVED_SLOTS=2`, `RETAIN_RESERVED_SLOTS=3`, `REFRESH_MENTAL_MODEL_RESERVED_SLOTS=2` → shared pool = `10 - (2+3+2) = 3`.

With the defaults (`MAX_SLOTS=10`, `CONSOLIDATION_RESERVED_SLOTS=2`, all other reservations `0`), 2 slots are always reserved for consolidation and the remaining 8 form the shared pool; consolidation may still overflow the shared pool up to 10. Set `CONSOLIDATION_RESERVED_SLOTS=0` to release its reserved capacity into the shared pool. Consolidation's bank-serialization constraint (no two consolidation tasks for the same bank concurrently) is preserved regardless of which pool claims the slot.

The legacy `..._MAX_SLOTS` env vars are a deprecated alias for `..._RESERVED_SLOTS` — despite the name they set the reservation floor, never a ceiling. They still work but log a warning; migrate to `..._RESERVED_SLOTS`.
:::

:::note Consolidation bank priority
`HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_CONSOLIDATION_BANK_PRIORITY` controls which banks' consolidation tasks are claimed first when a slot becomes available. Format: comma-separated `bank-pattern:priority` pairs where higher numbers mean higher priority. Patterns support `*` as a wildcard; a bare `*` is the catch-all default for unlisted banks (defaults to `1` if omitted).

Example:
```
HINDSIGHT_API_WORKER_CONSOLIDATION_BANK_PRIORITY="shadow-*:10,staging-*:5,*:1"
```

This ensures `shadow-*` banks are always consolidated before others, even if their tasks were submitted later. Useful for deployments with asymmetric bank sizes where a large bank might be starved by many small banks cycling through limited slots. Bank-serialization (max one concurrent consolidation per bank) is preserved regardless of priority. When unset, consolidation tasks are claimed in `created_at` order (default behavior).

### Performance Optimization

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_SKIP_LLM_VERIFICATION` | Skip LLM connection check on startup | `false` |

#### Bank stats cache

`get_bank_stats` aggregates over `memory_links` (joining `memory_units`), which can be a multi-second scan on banks with millions of rows. Because the result is intentionally approximate — it backs a UI widget and the freshness hint inside `reflect` — it is cached per `(schema, bank)` for a few tens of seconds, which also coalesces concurrent misses onto a single in-flight query. Tune it for high-concurrency or large-bank deployments:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_BANK_STATS_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | Time-to-live (seconds) for the `get_bank_stats` result cache. `0` disables caching, so every call runs the query. | `60` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_BANK_STATS_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES` | Maximum number of cached `(schema, bank)` entries before LRU eviction. Bounds memory in deployments with many banks. | `1024` |

#### Native thread pools

When local embeddings or reranking run in-process, the underlying BLAS/ML libraries (OpenBLAS, OpenMP, MKL) each spawn a worker pool sized to the host CPU count. Because Hindsight already parallelizes across requests via its own thread-pool executors, those native pools oversubscribe the CPU — on a many-core host the process can accumulate well over 100 native threads. This inflates memory and, under contention, can degrade throughput. Hindsight therefore bounds each native pool to **16 threads** (or the number of *available* CPUs, whichever is smaller) by default, capping runaway growth on large hosts while leaving within-call parallelism intact.

"Available" CPUs is the budget actually granted to the process — the smallest of the CPU-affinity set, the cgroup CPU quota (`--cpus` / cpuset), and the host core count. This matters in containers: the BLAS libraries otherwise size their pools to the *host's* cores even when the container is limited to a few, so a `--cpus=4` container on a 64-core host would spawn far more BLAS threads than it can run.

To tune, set any of these to the desired thread count; the value you set is always honored (the default applies only when the variable is unset):

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `OMP_NUM_THREADS` | OpenMP worker threads (torch, ONNX Runtime, some BLAS builds) | `min(16, available CPUs)` |
| `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS` | OpenBLAS worker threads (numpy's default BLAS) | `min(16, available CPUs)` |
| `MKL_NUM_THREADS` | Intel MKL worker threads (numpy/torch when MKL-backed) | `min(16, available CPUs)` |
| `NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS` | numexpr expression-engine threads | `min(16, available CPUs)` |

For a server handling many concurrent requests, lower values (down to `1`) favor request-level parallelism and minimize thread count; for low-concurrency deployments running large local-model batches, the default leaves room for within-call parallelism. These must be set in the process environment before startup (the libraries read them once, at load time), so they cannot be overridden per-tenant or per-bank.

### Webhooks

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WEBHOOK_URL` | Global webhook URL for event delivery | - (disabled) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | HMAC signing secret for webhook payloads | - (unsigned) |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WEBHOOK_EVENT_TYPES` | Comma-separated list of event types to deliver via webhook | `consolidation.completed` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | How often the webhook delivery worker polls for pending deliveries (seconds) | `30` |

### Audit Logging

Audit logging captures mutating operations (retain, recall, reflect, bank config updates, [Memory Defense](memory-defense/index.md) redact/block actions, etc.) into an `audit_log` table, queryable via the `/audit-logs` endpoint.

**Audit logging is disabled by default.** With `HINDSIGHT_API_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED=false`, the `audit_log` table stays empty and `/audit-logs` returns `{"total": 0, "items": []}` regardless of activity. Set the flag to `true` and restart the API to start capturing events.

**Auditing can be turned on or off for individual banks.** `audit_log_enabled` is hierarchical — overridable per bank via the [config API](#hierarchical-configuration) or the bank's **Configuration → Audit Logging** toggle in the control plane. The override works in both directions: a bank can opt *in* while the server default is `false`, or opt *out* while the default is `true`. Banks with no override follow the server default. Unlike the env var, a per-bank change takes effect immediately — no restart.

The actions allowlist and retention window stay server-level: retention is a global sweep across all tenants with no bank in scope.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED` | Whether audit events are written. Hierarchical — can be overridden per bank via the config API. | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_AUDIT_LOG_ACTIONS` | Comma-separated allowlist of action types to audit (empty = all eligible actions) | `""` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` | Number of days to retain audit log entries. `-1` = keep forever. | `-1` |

### LLM Request Tracing

LLM request tracing records every LLM call Hindsight makes — for retain, reflect, and consolidation — into an `llm_requests` table, queryable per bank via the `/llm-requests` endpoint. Each row captures the input messages, the model output, token usage (input / output / cached / total, taken from the provider response), finish reason, provider/model, timing, and caller metadata. **Failed calls are recorded too** (`status = "error"` with the error message), so the table is useful for debugging what the LLM is doing and why a call failed. Capture is wired into the OpenTelemetry GenAI recording path (the same `record_llm_call` hook used for OTLP span export), so it stays consistent with the provider-reported request details.

**LLM request tracing is enabled by default**, with traced rows retained for 1 day. To disable it entirely set `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TRACE_ENABLED=false` and restart the API — the `llm_requests` table then stays empty and `/llm-requests` returns `{"total": 0, "items": []}` regardless of activity.

> **Note:** Traced rows contain the full prompt and model output, which may include sensitive memory content and can be large. Use `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TRACE_MAX_CHARS` to bound how much of each payload is stored, tighten `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TRACE_RETENTION_DAYS`, or set `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TRACE_ENABLED=false` to turn tracing off in sensitive environments.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TRACE_ENABLED` | Master switch for LLM request tracing. Must be `true` for any calls to be recorded. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TRACE_SCOPES` | Comma-separated allowlist of call scopes to trace (e.g. `retain_extract_facts,reflect`; empty = all scopes) | `""` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TRACE_RETENTION_DAYS` | Number of days to retain trace rows. `-1` = keep forever. | `1` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_TRACE_MAX_CHARS` | Truncate stored input/output beyond this many characters (keeps the row, stores a truncated preview). | `50000` |

### Programmatic Configuration

You can also configure the API programmatically using `MemoryEngine.from_env()`:

```python
from hindsight_api import MemoryEngine

memory = MemoryEngine.from_env()
await memory.initialize()
```

---

## Observability & Tracing

Hindsight provides OpenTelemetry-based observability for LLM calls, conforming to GenAI semantic conventions.

### OpenTelemetry Tracing

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_OTEL_TRACES_ENABLED` | Enable distributed tracing for LLM calls | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | OTLP endpoint URL (e.g., Grafana LGTM, Langfuse, etc.) | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` | Headers for OTLP exporter (format: "key1=value1,key2=value2") | - |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | Service name for traces | `hindsight-api` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_OTEL_DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT` | Deployment environment name (e.g., development, staging, production) | `development` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_METRICS_INCLUDE_BANK_ID` | Include `bank_id` in OTel metric attributes. Enable only for deployments with few banks — high cardinality causes unbounded memory growth. | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_METRICS_BACKLOG_ENABLED` | Expose async-operation queue depth and consolidation-backlog gauges (`hindsight_async_operations`, `hindsight_consolidation_backlog`, `hindsight_consolidation_failed`). Runs periodic per-schema `COUNT` queries on a background task. | `false` |

**Features:**
- Full prompts and completions recorded as events
- Token usage tracking (input/output)
- Model and provider information
- Error tracking with finish reasons
- Conforms to OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions v1.37+

**OTLP-Compatible Backends:**

The tracing implementation uses standard OTLP HTTP protocol, so it works with any OTLP-compatible backend:
- **Grafana LGTM** (Recommended for local dev): All-in-one stack with Tempo traces, Loki logs, Mimir metrics, and Grafana UI
- **Langfuse**: LLM-focused observability and analytics
- **OpenLIT**: Built-in LLM dashboards, cost tracking
- **DataDog, New Relic, Honeycomb**: Commercial platforms

**Example Configuration:**

```bash
# Enable tracing
export HINDSIGHT_API_OTEL_TRACES_ENABLED=true

# Configure endpoint (example: OpenLIT Cloud)
export HINDSIGHT_API_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://otlp.openlit.io
export HINDSIGHT_API_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer olit-xxx"

# Optional: Custom service name and environment
export HINDSIGHT_API_OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=hindsight-production
export HINDSIGHT_API_OTEL_DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

**Local Development:**

For local development, we recommend the Grafana LGTM stack which provides traces, metrics, and logs in a single container:

```bash
./scripts/dev/start-grafana.sh
```

See `scripts/dev/grafana/README.md` for detailed setup instructions.

Other options: See `scripts/dev/openlit/README.md` for OpenLIT or `scripts/dev/jaeger/README.md` for standalone Jaeger.

### Runtime-Stall Diagnostics

The API and worker run the `/health` handler and all task work on a single asyncio
event loop, and `/health` acquires a database connection. So a liveness probe can
fail for two very different reasons: the **event loop is blocked** by synchronous
work (a restart helps), or the **connection pool is exhausted** and `/health` can't
get a connection even though the loop is idle (a restart usually doesn't help). These
diagnostics tell the two apart from the logs and metrics alone, instead of leaving
you with an opaque restart.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LOOP_WATCHDOG_ENABLED` | Run a background thread that detects event-loop stalls and logs the blocking stack. Also emits `hindsight_event_loop_stalls` / `hindsight_event_loop_stall_duration`. | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LOOP_WATCHDOG_STALL_THRESHOLD_MS` | Log a stall once the loop is unresponsive for at least this long. | `1000` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_LOOP_WATCHDOG_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | How often the watchdog thread pings the loop. | `250` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DB_ACQUIRE_WARN_THRESHOLD_MS` | Log a warning (with pool stats) when acquiring a pooled connection waits at least this long. | `1000` |

The DB-pool acquire path also exposes `hindsight_db_pool_waiting` (callers currently
queued for a connection) and the `hindsight_db_pool_acquire_wait` histogram. A slow
or failing `/health` response additionally carries `db_acquire_ms`, `db_pool_waiting`,
`db_pool_in_use`, and `db_pool_max` for triage.

### Metrics

Hindsight exposes Prometheus metrics at the `/metrics` endpoint, including:
- LLM call duration and token usage
- Operation duration (retain/recall/reflect)
- HTTP request metrics
- Database connection pool metrics

Metrics are always enabled and available at `http://localhost:8888/metrics`.

---

## Control Plane

The Control Plane is the web UI for managing memory banks.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_CP_DATAPLANE_API_URL` | URL of the API service | `http://localhost:8888` |
| `HINDSIGHT_CP_DATAPLANE_API_KEY` | Bearer token the Control Plane sends as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` on every request to the API service. Required when the API service is auth-protected; omit for a public API. | *(none — no `Authorization` header sent)* |
| `HINDSIGHT_CP_ACCESS_KEY` | Access key to protect the Control Plane UI. When set, users must enter this key to log in. | *(none — auth disabled)* |
| `HINDSIGHT_CP_MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE` | Maximum size of a single file-upload request the Control Plane accepts before truncating it. Accepts a size string (`100mb`, `1gb`) or a number of bytes. Raise this to upload files larger than the default, and keep it in line with the API's `HINDSIGHT_API_FILE_CONVERSION_MAX_BATCH_SIZE_MB`. | `100mb` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` | Base path for Control Plane UI when behind reverse proxy (e.g., `/hindsight`) | `""` (root) |

```bash
# Point Control Plane to a remote API service
export HINDSIGHT_CP_DATAPLANE_API_URL=http://api.example.com:8888

# Authenticate to an auth-protected API service
export HINDSIGHT_CP_DATAPLANE_API_KEY=my-dataplane-bearer-token

# Protect the Control Plane with an access key
export HINDSIGHT_CP_ACCESS_KEY=my-secret-key
```

### Hierarchical Configuration

Hindsight supports per-bank configuration overrides through a hierarchical system: **Global (env vars) → Tenant → Bank**.

#### Type-Safe Config Access

To prevent accidentally using global defaults when bank-specific overrides exist, Hindsight enforces type-safe config access:

**In Application Code:**
```python
from hindsight_api.config import get_config

# ✅ Access static (infrastructure) fields
config = get_config()
host = config.host  # OK - static field
port = config.port  # OK - static field

# ❌ Attempting to access bank-configurable fields raises an error
chunk_size = config.retain_chunk_size  # ConfigFieldAccessError!
```

**Error Message:**
```
ConfigFieldAccessError: Field 'retain_chunk_size' is bank-configurable and cannot
be accessed from global config. Use ConfigResolver.resolve_full_config(bank_id, context)
to get bank-specific config.
```

**For Bank-Specific Config:**
```python
# Internal code that needs bank-specific settings
from hindsight_api.config_resolver import ConfigResolver

# Resolve full config for a specific bank
config = await config_resolver.resolve_full_config(bank_id, request_context)
chunk_size = config.retain_chunk_size  # ✅ Uses bank-specific value
```

This design prevents bugs where global defaults are used instead of bank overrides, making it impossible to make this mistake at compile/development time.

#### Security Model

Configuration fields are categorized for security:

1. **Configurable Fields** - Safe behavioral settings that can be customized per-bank:
   - Retention: `retain_chunk_size`, `retain_structured_chunk_size`, `retain_extraction_mode`, `retain_mission`, `retain_custom_instructions`
   - Observations: `enable_observations`, `enable_auto_consolidation`, `observations_mission`, `max_observations_per_scope`
   - MCP access control: `mcp_enabled_tools`

2. **Credential Fields** - NEVER exposed or configurable via API:
   - API keys: `*_api_key` (all LLM API keys)
   - Infrastructure: `*_base_url` (all base URLs)

3. **Static Fields** - Server-level only, cannot be overridden:
   - Infrastructure: `database_url`, `port`, `host`, `worker_count`
   - Provider/Model selection: `llm_provider`, `llm_model` (requires presets - not yet implemented)
   - Performance tuning: `llm_max_concurrent`, `llm_timeout`, retrieval settings, optimization flags

#### Enabling the API

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_BANK_CONFIG_API` | Enable per-bank config API | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_BANK_LLM_HEALTH` | Enable the per-bank LLM connectivity probe (`POST /v1/default/banks/{bank_id}/health/llm`). It makes a real provider call, so it is **off by default** — enable it to expose the endpoint. Returns status only — never the provider/model/endpoint. | `false` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_ENABLE_DRY_RUN_EXTRACT` | Enable the dry-run extraction preview endpoint (`POST /v1/default/banks/{bank_id}/memories/dry-run-extract`). Runs extraction only — makes a real LLM call but stores nothing. Set to `false` to remove the endpoint (returns `404`). | `true` |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_DEFAULT_BANK_TEMPLATE` | Bank template manifest (JSON) applied automatically to every newly-created bank. See below. | _(unset)_ |

##### `HINDSIGHT_API_DEFAULT_BANK_TEMPLATE`

Server-level default bank template. When set, the manifest is applied once
to every bank the server creates — triggered the first time a bank is
touched (via `PUT /v1/default/banks/{bank_id}`, `/import`, `/retain`, etc.).
The value is a JSON-encoded `BankTemplateManifest` with the same shape
accepted by `POST /v1/default/banks/{bank_id}/import` (see the `bank`,
`mental_models`, and `directives` sections in the Bank Templates API).

Precedence: fields set by the template become per-bank overrides, so they
take precedence over the equivalent `HINDSIGHT_API_*` env-var defaults
(e.g. `HINDSIGHT_API_RETAIN_EXTRACTION_MODE`). Users can still override
individual fields later via `PATCH /v1/default/banks/{bank_id}/config`;
the template is **not** re-applied on subsequent accesses, so explicit
overrides are never clobbered.

A malformed manifest (bad JSON, unknown version, schema errors) is logged
and ignored — bank creation still succeeds with plain defaults, so a
broken server-level setting cannot wedge all callers.

Example (compact, single-line JSON as required by env vars):

```bash
export HINDSIGHT_API_DEFAULT_BANK_TEMPLATE='{"version":"1","bank":{"reflect_mission":"Help support agents remember customer interactions.","retain_extraction_mode":"verbose","disposition_empathy":5},"directives":[{"name":"Be concise","content":"Always respond concisely.","priority":10}]}'
```

#### API Endpoints

- `GET /v1/default/banks/{bank_id}/config` - View resolved config (filtered by permissions)
- `PATCH /v1/default/banks/{bank_id}/config` - Update bank overrides (only allowed fields)
- `DELETE /v1/default/banks/{bank_id}/config` - Reset to defaults

#### Permission System

Tenant extensions can control which fields banks are allowed to modify via `get_allowed_config_fields()`:

```python
class CustomTenantExtension(TenantExtension):
    async def get_allowed_config_fields(self, context, bank_id):
        # Option 1: Allow all configurable fields
        return None

        # Option 2: Allow specific fields only
        return {"retain_chunk_size", "retain_custom_instructions"}

        # Option 3: Read-only (no modifications)
        return set()
```

#### Examples

```bash
# Update retention settings for a bank
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8888/v1/default/banks/my-bank/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "updates": {
      "retain_chunk_size": 4000,
      "retain_extraction_mode": "custom",
      "retain_custom_instructions": "Focus on technical details and implementation specifics"
    }
  }'

# Note: retain_extraction_mode must be "custom" to use retain_custom_instructions

# View resolved config (respects permissions)
curl http://localhost:8888/v1/default/banks/my-bank/config

# Reset to defaults
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8888/v1/default/banks/my-bank/config
```

**Security Notes:**
- Credentials (API keys, base URLs) are never returned in responses
- Only configurable fields can be modified
- Responses are filtered by tenant permissions
- Attempting to set credentials returns 400 error

### Reverse Proxy / Subpath Deployment

To deploy Hindsight under a subpath (e.g., `example.com/hindsight/`):

1. Set both environment variables to the same path:
   ```bash
   HINDSIGHT_API_BASE_PATH=/hindsight
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/hindsight
   ```

2. Configure your reverse proxy to:
   - Forward `/hindsight/*` requests to Hindsight
   - Preserve the full path in forwarded requests
   - Set appropriate proxy headers (X-Forwarded-Proto, X-Forwarded-For)

**Example: Nginx Configuration**

```nginx
location /hindsight/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8888/;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```

**Example: Traefik Configuration**

```yaml
http:
  routers:
    hindsight:
      rule: "PathPrefix(`/hindsight`)"
      service: hindsight
      middlewares:
        - hindsight-stripprefix

  middlewares:
    hindsight-stripprefix:
      stripPrefix:
        prefixes:
          - "/hindsight"

  services:
    hindsight:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://localhost:8888"
```

**Important Notes:**
- The base path must start with `/` and should NOT end with `/`
- Both API and Control Plane should use the same base path
- After setting environment variables, restart both services
- OpenAPI docs will be available at `<base-path>/docs` (e.g., `/hindsight/docs`)

**Complete Examples:**

See `docker/compose-examples/` directory for:
- Nginx configuration files (`simple.conf`, `api-and-control-plane.conf`)
- Docker Compose setups (`docker-compose.yml`, `reverse-proxy-only.yml`)
- Traefik and other reverse proxy examples
